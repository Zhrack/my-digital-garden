Recently a town was born around a Keep built to protect a sacred magical anomaly.

Town is quite rich and affluent in trade.
Did the magical anomaly change and attract trade? 
    Yes, an experiment activated the crystal in the Keep, 
    that is influencing the region in growing magical crystals, full of energy.
What is the Unique Shipping Method? 
    A magitech device created from the crystals allows for airships to transport goods.
    New devices are being developed, we are at the beginning of this field.

Keep is heavily fortified. Who is threatening the magical anomaly?
    A rival kingdom is trying to sabotage trade routes.
