# Intro
This is a fantasy hexcrawl campaign. My main drive for this game is to test Savage Worlds Adventure Edition and a bunch of other tools.

For this campaign I'll use a few tools:
- SWADE
- SWADE Fantasy Companion
- Mythic GME 2e 
    - Fate Check
    - Fluid Scenes (from a Mythic Magazine, I'll play without the discrete scene structure. Instead a Scene Question will be asked at turning points, to see if the Chaos Factor changes)
    - News Feeds to generate events in the locations that I'll find
    - Mystery Matrix, in case of mystery to investigate
- Hexcrawl Toolkit for the hexcrawl procedure (only the required rules, to keep things simple.) Can be found at [[Solo Games/Savage Worlds Fantasy Hexcrawl/Play/Hexcrawl Resources\|Hexcrawl Resources]].
- Spectacular Settlements, to generate important settlements.
- Location and Event Crafter
- Stretch goals, if I have the occasion/inclination to do so:
    - Solipsism, for location generation using a choose-your-own-adventure-book style
    - Plot/Game/Scene Unfolding Machine tools. To be used mainly for inspiration tables. If I feel fancy, I could switch to PUM at some point instead of Mythic GME for the oracle as well.
    - FlexAI to run monsters, especially in combat
    - Let's Talk, for conversations.

# World Building
I created a town using Spectacular Settlements, called [[Solo Games/Savage Worlds Fantasy Hexcrawl/Play/Locations/Hoverkirk sheet\|Solo Games/Savage Worlds Fantasy Hexcrawl/Play/Locations/Hoverkirk sheet]].
This town was born around a temple, which is airborne due to the magical anomaly that is protecting.
This magical anomaly led to the discovery of a magical crystal, used by its inhabitants as a source of energy and to develop magitech items.
This ushered an economic boom for this remote town, which was providing their services of airships powered by crystals, for trading all over the world.
The flying temple where the magical anomaly is, is managed and protected by the [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Factions/Arcane Protectors\|Arcane Protectors]].
A separate faction within this group, called the [[Solo Games/Savage Worlds Fantasy Hexcrawl/Play/Factions/Red Arcanists\|Red Arcanists]], have taken a more religious view of the magical anomaly, starting an internal strife with the [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Factions/Arcane Protectors\|Arcane Protectors]].
In recent history, this conflict has reached a point where the group has separated, leaving the town and, in the last few days, hijacking an airship for unknown reasons.

Our party, composed of a joke-cracking Dwarf Cleric of [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Religions/Tramadir\|Tramadir]] named [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Drukmor.excalidraw\|Drukmor.excalidraw]] and the grim Human Soldier [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Gultag.excalidraw\|Gultag.excalidraw]], have accepted the mission from the Protectors to retrieve the airship. The only lead for now is the [[Solo Games/Savage Worlds Fantasy Hexcrawl/Play/Locations/Red Arcanists Watchtower\|Red Arcanists Watchtower]], where the group has been seen.

# Session 1
We start with the mission already taken, ready to leave Hoverkirk for the [[Solo Games/Savage Worlds Fantasy Hexcrawl/Play/Locations/Red Arcanists Watchtower\|Red Arcanists Watchtower]].

> I guess we found the Watchtower!

Here is our current map.

> [!SWADE] SWADE
> What do we see?
> Both Drukmor and Gultag do a Notice check.
> Drukmor: 4. Gultag: 5. Both successes.
> Descriptor: Intensely Healthy.
> 

> Once arrived near the watchtower, they see a relatively low and thick stone building, with a flat top. More than for scouting, the building seems to be a small keep. Around the circular base, a square multifloor building protrudes from a side, giving more living space.

> [!Mythic] Mythic
> Is the airship here? Likely. CF 5. Forgot to check the Scene, oh well. It's Expected. CF to 6. 6, 1. 9. No.

> One thing they immediately notice is the lack of airship hovering near the top of the tower, the only place where it would be.
> "Where is the ship?" says Gultag.
> "We are going to ask inside." says Drukmor, with a smirk. 
> The duo looks at the situation.

> [!SWADE] SWADE
> Drukmor Notice: 4.
> Gultag Notice: 3.

> [!Mythic] Mythic
> Are there any guards outside? Likely. 5, 1. 8. No.

> Both don't see anyone outside the building, but probably lookouts are inside looking from windows. Or not.

> [!Solipsism] Solipsism
> Let's use Solipsism to explore this location.
> I fill up this Map. Should be faster than setting up LC or anything else.
> ![Pasted image 20231214232231.png](/img/user/z_Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231214232231.png)
> We start from 1002 after rolling a d4.
> Go to 7197. Location A, -2 (everything easier 2 steps during this scene), hallucination mood word, Path 7588 with +2 modifier.

> The duo reaches slowly the entrance of the low stone building hugging the side of the tower and opens the door.

> [!Mythic] Mythic
> Is it locked? Likely. 9, 5. 14. Yes.
> 

> [!SWADE] SWADE
> Thievery skill check to lockpick it.
> Malus of -2 given by the Solipsism modifier. Both are also unskilled at it...
> Gultag: 3. Drukmor... -3 with both 1s. So, Critical Failure.

> [!Mythic] Mythic
> Is there a trap? Likely. 8, 1. 11. Yes.
> It's a fire trap, that sends a flameout in the face of Drukmor. 1d6 damage, 3 and doesn't catch fire. Soaked by his Toughness of 7, so no damage.

> Drukmor cough for the improvise fire, but a part from some burned out hairs on his dwarven beard and a burned ego, nothing else happens.
> The door is still closed.
> "Damn door, that's the last drop of my 1-drop container" says Drakmor, preparing to impulsively hit the door.

> [!SWADE] SWADE
> Fighting roll with his light club. 5. 5 damage.
> Enough to break down the door I guess.

> The duo enters past the ruined door. 

> [!Mythic] Mythic
> Domicile: Lightly Damaged.
> FQ: Is there anyone? Likely. 10, 8. 20. Extreme Yes.
> I guess a combat is ongoing. Who are the Red Arcanists fighting? Let's roll on the Characters list. Town Watch Lieutenant.

> The interior of this one-room building appears damaged in its furniture, this is due to an ongoing skirmish between two groups, doing what seems a unorganized brawl among tables of what seemed once a trading post main local. Weapons are unsheathed, more heated than a tavern brawl.
> Town Guards, together with the Lieutenant, are engaged.
> The due comes to aid and a short combat ensues (done in Foundry), where three mages of the Red Arcanists are killed, without allied hurts.

> [!SUM/GUM] SUM/GUM
> Who is the Lieutenant? Let's use SUM and GUM
> Stereotype: Chooser of the Chosen One: Often an older mentor / Liar: Character who consistently canâ€™t tell the truth
> Attitude: Despite disliking you, remain respectful and calm
> Contribution: Talks about a useful, dangerous, or wonderful place
> GUM Useful Findings: Personal relationships of an enemy
> 

> The Lieutenant thanks us with a smidge of embarrassment. He doesn't like adventurers like us, that is known across the village.
> He talks about his attack to the tower in an effort to retrieve the airship as well, but he says that the vehicle was moved away as soon as they attacked, blowing the surprise of the attack just before doing it.
> They tried to conquer the structure but were still engaging with the first group of defenders. More are probably in the next locations here. Conquering the structure might prove beneficial for the town of Hoverkirk though, so they ask us to finish the job, while they try to keep up with the airship movements. A message will be sent as soon as they have information. 
> Do the PCs catch the lie?

> [!SWADE] SWADE
> Notice.
> Drukmor: 11. Success with raise.
> Gultag: 2. Fail.

> Drukmor understands that no call will ever arrive from the Lieutenant, he doesn't like "mercenaries". The hopes of reaching a moving airship on foot are quite slim, so maybe they will find some clues on the destination inside the tower, or from a Red Arcanist.
> The duo agrees with the Lieutenant, parting ways.
> They both continue inside the main body of the tower.

> [!Solipsism] Solipsism
> Path 7588 goes to 8091.
> ![Pasted image 20231221231347.png](/img/user/z_Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231221231347.png)
> Final modifier: +1
> B is Tower Ground Floor, with an Ethereal theme.
> Object 1 is "Clue about airship". Lucky! With a positive theme as well. Final modifier regarding the clue is 0.

> [!GUM] GUM
> Useful Findings: Confirmation of intel, proof, evidence
> Clue type: Infomally written notes.
> Enemy activities: Talking to someone secretely, plotting.
> Location by content: Religious artifacts, symbols, offerings, rituals

This tracks with the ethereal theme from Solipsism. 
What is this faction doing with the religious altar?

> [!Gum] GUM
> Faction focus: Ascension: Aims to achieve a higher state of being, power, or enlightenment
> Surplus: Religion: Strong, devout, or charismatic faith to motivate, heal, or convert others
> Needs: Trade: Stability, goods, services, or markets that they can use to sell and buy things
> 

> [!PUM] PUM
> Why the altars?
> Reason (Why): For protection or survival
> Explain (Why): Accident, side effect

The Red Arcanists have developed a religious belief around the crystals and want to use them for some side effect. I'll leave it undefined for now, it's not really needed.
The airship is useful for trading or financial help and the clue is evidence, regarding the airship probably.
So, putting it all together:

> Gultag and Drukmor enters the main tower building, where the circular room has spiraling stairs along the perimeter of the stone walls. The open space has been adapted to some kind of religious temple and general work area, dividing the space evenly between the two functions.
> The religious space has some pieces of Crystal on an altar, encased in a metal handler, but kept unpolished and still slightly glowing in magical energy.
> The work area instead has some correspondence between Red Arcanists where they agree on keeping the airship moving in case of retaliation from Hoverkirk, plotting the airship's itinerary to a second place.

> [!GUM] GUM
> 
> Location by purpose: Hospitality, food, sleep, drinks, socializing

I would say some kind of tavern. Since it's controlled by the Red Arcanists, it's going to be outside, so maybe more of a small trading post than a single building.

> The trading post is called The Drinking Fire, but the location is not shared.

Do they know the place?

> [!SWADE] SWADE
> Common Knowledge
> Drukmor: 4
> Gultag: 5

Since they know where it is, during the hexcrawl after each discovered feature, I'll ask a FQ whether we arrived. If yes, we found the place.

The duo continues their exploration of the tower.
It's also time for a Scene Question.
"They finish exploring the ground floor without issues and move to the next area, right?" 9. Expected, CF increases to 7.

> [!Solipsism] Solipsism
> Outgoing Path: 4141 at -1.
> Go To: 4875
> 
> ![Pasted image 20231224001339.png](/img/user/z_Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231224001339.png)
> Location C is First Floor with surveillance theme. No modified difficulty.
> Danger 1 is Red Arcanists guards with optics flavor. Characters harder by 1 step.

> [!GUM] GUM
> 
> Location by content: Darkness, invisible, hard to see, fuzzy, nothing
> Character by possession: Rich, wealthy, fancy clothes, ornaments, rings

> The floor is kept in the dark, with most of the light coming from what can be described as irregular pieces of glass floating in mid air and as big as a person. On each side of each piece of glass, moving images of other locations can be seen. The duo recognizes the locations showed as different parts of Hoverkirk, but also other locations, together with the [[Solo Games/Savage Worlds Fantasy Hexcrawl/Play/Locations/The Drinking Fire\|The Drinking Fire]] trading post, this very tower and other kingdoms.
> Seems like the RA is monitoring places by unknown, probably magical, means, but no one seems to notice  being observed.

FQ:"Do the RA present here ambush them?" Very Likely given the ongoing attack they are aware of. 1, 2. 5 total. No, almost exceptional.

What's their attitude then?

> [!SUM] SUM
> Rolling with disadvantage since they should tend negative towards the PCs.
> Attitude: Act very defensively, ready for a fight if it has to be.
> Contribution: Has a weapon, or means to complicate PCs goals
> Opinion: Disagree, dislike and will oppose it however they can

Ok... this is confusing. Do the PCs notice them in the darkness at least?

> [!SWADE] SWADE
> Notice check
> Drukmor: 8. Success with raise
> Gultag: 4. Success.

> [!SUM] SUM
> Since I'm not sure how to proceed, let's do a SUM GM intervention.
> - GM... Puts someone who prevents the PCs from advancing
> Action: Offer, give, provide, present, gift, grant, trust
> Adjective: Undiscovered, new, untouched, born, virgin
> Subject: Conflict, invasion, war, battle, large scale skirmish

> [!Mythic] Mythic
> FQ: "Do they offer information in exchange of not being killed?" Likely. 6, 2. 11. Yes

> While looking at the spying glasses, the duo spots a couple of opulently dressed Red Arcanists, with their red robes enriched by some jewelry, denoting their status as specialists. Probably about this type of divination magic.
> Both of them are in a corner, hands in the air after seeing from a glass the battle that just ended. One of them has what seems to be a round device with a piece of cloth coming out of the metal frame, a lit torch in the other hand.
> "Stop there! Not a step further or all this glass explodes in your face!"
> Drukmor: "Whoah whoah whoah kiddo, you're serious about the acupuncture regime there? I can patch me and my buddy together, not sure I'll be in the mood for you as well"

> [!SWADE] SWADE
> 
> Persuasion check
> Drukmor: d8, d6. 1, 2.
> Benny time! 1, 4. Success.

> The cultists look at each other, feeling a bit stupid after what they thought was going to be a good plan.
> "Please spare us, we can be of help! Just let us go!"

> [!PUM] PUM
> Why the theft of the airship? Obtain object you get/have. In line with trading results of before.
