So, during last session, I had two separate encounter checks. One for the noise made, one for the time.  
Only issue is, I forgot one step, the actual encounter check! After rolling it, none of them came 1, so no actual encounters!  
Still I'll keep the zombies. Everyone likes zombies.

> After generating the room, we have a 6x3 sq room, with a locked wooden door on the right.  
> No monsters or anything. ("Empty", but I don't really like the word. It's never really empty).

> The room is devoid of life, minus some mushrooms covering a corner of the room.  
> The orcs thank the adventurers, taking a small piece of paper and doing a bad drawing of the next few rooms, pointing at a specific room, which seems important.

> [!NOTE]-
> Do they understand what's the importance of the room?  
> Drukmor: 1, 1. Nope. Critical fail.  
> Gultag: 9, 10. Success with raise.  
> Reason: For glory, status, reputation

> Gultag manages to understand that the indicated room is probably a throne room or other central gathering place of the orc community here.
> After finishing the sketch, the orcs continue, but going in a different direction than the indicated room.
> The duo looks at the sketch to discuss the next moves.

> [!NOTE]-
> This will require at least 10 minutes after also searching the room, so an encounter check will be done.
> But first, let's generate the next few rooms.

> Well, seems like I overdid it a bit and finished the available rooms for this level, 13 (I mistakenly counted the first corridor as well, won't fix it now). Which is also quite limiting given with what we know, there is supposed to be an entire section for the wererats.
> Since I like this dynamic in this level, I'll just double the rooms on this level to 26.
> Sandbox Generator seems to lack a way to let dungeon generations come to a natural conclusion, instead leaving a cut off when the room limit is reached. Not smooth, might need to change later.
> The section north of room A6-1-4 (Level A6-1 room 4, maybe I can drop the A of Area to simplify... What about using letters for the Area instead? Like that, it would become F1-4 for room 4. A dash and letter less. Worth it!)
> 
> Ah, we also were going to search room 4.
> Drukmor: 2, 1. Fail.
> Gultag: 2, 2. Fail.
> No benny here, but they don't find anything interesting. The mushrooms don't seem that interesting either
> 
> Now, the encounter check. 1d8. 7. Nothing. Tick the time.

> After discussing what to do and seeing the Orcs Main Hall being relatively close, they decide to explore in that direction in search of something useful. Maybe they will not encounter the Orcs if they are sneaky.
> Drukmor: "Those orcs we met were probably not welcome at the Main Hall, if they were blocked outside their territory. Better to steer clear if they know we helped them."
> Gultag nods.

> [!NOTE]-
> Now let's see if the north Orc section hides the secret passage to E1.
> From now on, I'm going to use the preview version of PUM v8.1, with a new Disruption Die mechanic. When rolling oracles, roll a d10. On a 1, it triggers a random prompt. On a 2, a modified proposal.
> Is the secret passage to E1 in this section? Weak yes. DD: 1! Random Prompt: Foreshadow an imminent problem. What problem? Weapons/Tools. This also triggers in my opinion a world element, "Hellish influences in F1"!
> 
> Here is the current PUM plot node sheet for F1.

> 
> So I think, the passage's here somewhere (secret doors or not), but the passage can be hard to find. For the random prompt, I have an idea.

> While they discuss the next steps, they both fail to notice what is happening around them, when suddenly, they find themselves in the dark, with the lantern turning off.

> [!NOTE]-
> Is the fuel of Drukmor all depleted? Yes. DD: 3.
> Is the fuel of Gultag all depleted? (Unlikely) Weak no. DD: 6.
> 

> After checking their lanterns, they discover how some kind of reddish rust has overgrown the lantern of [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Drukmor.excalidraw\|Drukmor.excalidraw]], consuming its light and all the fuel (3 pints).
> After quickly checking [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Gultag.excalidraw\|Gultag.excalidraw]]'s one, they discover a similar rust starting to grow, but they see the effects on the fuel as well, leaving them with roughly 2 pints from the 5 Gultag was carrying.
> 
> Gultag lights up the lantern and they quickly reach for the corridor, hoping to leave the blood rust behind.

> [!NOTE]
> Does the [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/World Elements/Blood Rust\|Blood Rust]] applies only on emitters of light? Weak no.
> Interesting.

Will our heroes manage to finish this expedition with some light?
