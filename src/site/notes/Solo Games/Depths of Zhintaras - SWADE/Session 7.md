I'm prepping this new level and doing some changes to the game, which I explain in the following paragraphs. If you want to skip directly to the Actual Play, go [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/Session 7#Actual Play \|here]].

# Some prep before playing
Last session, our adventurers found a secret passage to E1, the Scarlet Tomb!

First I generated a major event for the background of the place using News Feeds.
![Pasted image 20240309231553.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240309231553.png)
This gave me the idea of the curse.
These are the Threads and Characters I know are there:
![Pasted image 20240309231953.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240309231953.png)

Then I generated a second major event for the recent history of the Scarlet Tomb
![Pasted image 20240309232331.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240309232331.png)

So this is the final result after updating the lists:
![Pasted image 20240309232350.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240309232350.png)

I interpreted a short history of the place, [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Megadungeon/E1 Scarlet Tomb/E1 Key#History \|here]].
Our PCs don't know anything about this.

Here is PUM plot nodes:
![Pasted image 20240309234501.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240309234501.png)

![Pasted image 20240309234522.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240309234522.png)

# Changes to "playflow"
In F1 I used Sandbox Generator to create the detailed map. While the result was quite good, I didn't like that I ended up with very long corridors (and rooms far away from each other) and didn't get any loops to aid navigation.
To help with that, a change I could do is to modify the default length of a corridor segment from 6 squares to 3. This should cluster rooms a bit more together and hopefully lead to higher chance of loops.

Since there has been GM's Day of DriveThruRPG though, I searched for some OSR resource for SWADE and I found them.
These are Gold&Glory: Seven Deadly Dungeons (https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/283156/gold-glory-seven-deadly-dungeons-savage-worlds-adventure-edition) and its Solo supplement (https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/295437/gold-glory-solo-gmless-and-one-on-one-adventures).

Inside there are advices to handle advancement, generate detailed dungeons on the fly using a standard deck of cards, better rules for hirelings and a slot-based inventory system (this last one I might use, not sure yet).
Since this is the new shiny, I will generate E1's map using this system instead and decide which one I like the most.

Enough with the talk, let's roll some dice!

# Actual Play
> After opening the passage, Veth thanks the group and gives a well made Ruby Necklace of higher value than the previous reward (2000 gp).
> The wererats then start following the passage, only the torches visible while they go further away.
> Drukmor and Gultag look at each other for a moment. Then look behind to the entrance to this room. Then look each other again.
> "Let's stick to the group, no one ever found this passage, it's going to have lots of undiscovered treasures."
> The duo and the group of Wererats walk and climb for one hour inside a very roughly excavated passage, seemingly very old and partially collapsed in some places.

> [!NOTE]
> We have a dwarf in our party. Does Drukmor recognizes the hands of Kobolds in these passage?
> Common Knowledge: d4, d6. 1, 1. Critical Fail! Something bad happens, let's ask PUM.
> Random Prompt: Lay out a skill challenge: Use for a craft, magic, or tech.
> Focus: Chant/Rite
> Description: dangerous
> Stakes: Face a deadline, or hurry
> I'll add "Who is making the chants?" to the Pending Questions list in the PUM Plot Nodes.

> While following along the passage, the group starts to see the terrain getting progressively more reddish in colour, a faint chant can be heard far away in the dark.
> The terrain around starts to sprout red spiky vines very fast, prompting the group to run forward while completely panicked. 
> The chant stops after a few seconds, the vines die away, desiccating at the same velocity of their birth and turning to dust. The red colour disappears from the dirt of the passage. 
> At the same time, they reach a new chamber, unsure on what just happened but unscathed.

> [!NOTE]
> Let's generate the first room they reach, using the Gold&Glory system.
> From a standard deck without aces, faces and jokers (so only cards from 2 to 10), pick 3 cards.
> I pick **6 hearts, 5 spades, 8 diamonds**. 1 black, 2 reds.
> 
> Dimensions:
>     The room is 6x5 (inches at the table, 2 yards in the world or 6 feets). 
>     So it's going to be 36x30 feets. Round to **35x30** feets for ease of use.
>     8 on the third card means two exits, both of them are open passages (archways, broken walls, etc) since the majority of cards are red.
>     
>    ![Pasted image 20240331232715.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240331232715.png)
>  
> Content:
>     Black cards means Empty/nothing special.
>     Diamonds means Treasure. Hearts means Hazards.
>     We have a Treasure and a Hazard.
> 
> To better define the content, I could make my own table for each card, use another source as inspiration or use one of the seven predefined lists in the Gold&Glory book.
> For now I'll use FORGE Dungeon generation. Treasure will mean a result of Dungeon Discovery = Find, which can be an unguarded or guarded treasure (or a double roll).
> ![Pasted image 20240310222137.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240310222137.png)
> 
> For Hazards, I'll roll on the Dungeon Danger table. 
> ![Pasted image 20240310222215.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240310222215.png)
> and follow from there to other tables.
> As my addition, for each black suit I draw, I'll roll on the rest of the Dungeon Discovery table to aid in flavouring the place. 
> ![Pasted image 20240310222601.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240310222601.png)
> 
> So, I have a Treasure, a Hazard and a Flavour, let's roll with it.
> Flavour:
>     3. Feature. 5. Structure. 5. Alcoves or niches.
> Hazard:
>     1. Trap. 12. Ambush. 
>     What can be a signpost or giveaway of the trap?
>     PUM Focus: foggy/lost. 
> Treasure:
>     1. Unguarded Treasure. 1x Gem of 500 gp value. Pearl, Topaz, etc.
> 

> The group arrives in this ancient stone room and immediately notice the numerous alcoves on the walls, consumed by time and covered in diffused thorny red roses. A thick and dense white fog hides the pavement, but the depressions in the white fog betrays the presence of numerous depressions on the ground, around half a meter deep for the most part.
> 

> [!NOTE]
> We know that there is an ambush ready here. I feel inspired that the ambushers are the Kobolds, so no need to roll. I like thinking of them as crafty albeit more technologically primitive than other crafty ancestries like gnomes or dwarves. So we can expect an abundance of mechanical traps and simple weapons and armours from them, made with stone, wood and other simple materials.
> Also they are great team workers, rarely attacking alone to compensate for the smaller stature.
> 
> Reaction roll:
> ![2D Reaction Table.png](/img/user/z_Attachments/2D%20Reaction%20Table.png)
> X: 11, Y: 9 = Very lonely. 
> Q: Are they a group separated from the rest? 50/50. No. No disruption
> So I guess the whole faction feels lonely. Maybe against the cursed vegetation or another faction.
> 
> I would need to roll Notice checks for both groups, but if they are ambushing, I assume they notice automatically.
> Gultag: d6, d6. 5, 3. Success.
> Drukmor: d6, d6. 3, 2. Fail.
> Wererats group roll: d10, d6. 8, 2. Success with raise.
 > 
 > Ok, all seems clear. PUM scene proposal time.
 > Proposal: The two groups see each other and there is an initial standoff.
 > PUM: Introduce welcoming good news.
 > Reason: Mostly about wealth or riches
 > Focus: Fortress/Tower
 
 > The groups see each other immediately in the dim light of the torches of the new arrivals.
 > The wererats react swiftly, putting themselves on the defensive, while Gultag readies himself in defence of Drukmor. 
 > The Kobolds react with aggressiveness at first, emerging from the hidden alcoves on the ground, before recognizing the group as extraneous to the level and remaining ready to attack but steadying their weapons while studying the situation.
 > 
 > After a few tense moments, the Wererats speak in Common: "We are not attackers, we are refugees from the other side! We mean to harm!" 

> [!NOTE]
> SUM Character Emulation:
> Response: Promise to act against it, if the idea moves forward
> Plot contribution: Talks about a useful, dangerous, or wonderful place
> Which place?
> Place and Focus: Is holy, sacred, or somehow cursed & dark/evil

> After a brief discussions between them, the group of kobolds speaks with squeaky voices: "We don't need another group in our zone. You can pass through, but not stay. If you want a new place, there is the old Scarlet Temple in these catacombs."
> The Kobold point their finger to the north passage, where a makeshift wooden door blocks it.
> "Remnants of the builders haunt those halls, danger abound. Yet, if you cleanse it of their remnants, you will have a place to stay and we will be grateful for it."
> The Kobold then points to the other open archway.
> "To pass through our domains instead, we demand a toll of 25gp. You will be escorted to the other passage."
> Looking at the adventurers instead: "The same is valid for you."

> [!NOTE]
> This will be room [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Megadungeon/E1 Scarlet Tomb/E1 Key#1\|E1 Key#1]].
> The Scarlet Temple has this description instead: [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Megadungeon/E1 Scarlet Tomb/E1 Key#? Scarlet Temple\|E1 Key#? Scarlet Temple]].

> The [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Megadungeon/F1 Hellish Burrow/Factions/Wererats\|Wererats]] pay the toll.

TODO: 
What is the choice of adventurers? Wererats prefer to pass through. The adventurers will go to the temple and part ways.
