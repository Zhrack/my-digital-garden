After defining the starting location where we are, we are in [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Outside Locations/Hoverkirk\|Hoverkirk]].

We start in front of the [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Megadungeon/F1 Hellish Burrow/F1 News Feed.excalidraw\| Hellish Burrow]] entrance.

> [!NOTE] News Feed
> Let's define a News Feed for the first level.
> I will generate 2 Major Events. One in the past, before the discovery. The other a recent one. This should inform the current status quo and dynamics.
> 
> I know we have 2 factions present.   
> **Past Major Event**: New Thread. Plot Twist meaning table: Rare Danger.
> A rare monster has appeared in this level from the lower levels and has disrupted a zone and the status quo.
> The new thread is "A rare monster has arrived".
> 
> **Recent Major Event**: Move Toward a thread.
> Undead Descriptor: Control Dangerous.
> The creature has started accumulating a force and taking terrain. This is going to be the first faction. The exact identity will be found later.
> Here is the sheet at this point, with some general characters added.

> The due reaches the entrance of the Hellish Burrow, where a group of soldiers stands watch, to block anything to exit The Depths.
Traces of old blood are splattered throughout the place, indicating past attacks from the denizens. In front of the irregular cave, a heavy stone door has been placed to block the passage, moved with the help of some horses rotating the circular door sideways. 
The soldiers are used to adventurers entering and sometimes returning, so no one talks to them.

> A one-eyed veteran soldier looks at them and commands to open the door.
"Whenever you manage to make it out alive, fresh meat, just ring the bell on the other side and we will open. If you are alone."
Said that, Drukmor and Gultag enter inside, before being quickly left in the darkness of the excavated corridor.

Drukmor fills up and lights his lantern, illuminating the view. A long corridor made of excavated earth with a stone door at its end.

> [!NOTE] Checks
> Is the corridor showing anything about its Hellish name? Strong no.

The duo continues until the door.

> [!NOTE] Checks
> Is it trapped? Yes   
> Type of trap? 61. Pit trap.   
> Let's see if they see it. Notice check.   
> Drukmor: 11, 2. Success.   
> Gultag: 8, 2. Success. 

> Both of them notice that just in front of the door, a pit is covered rudimentarily by a piece of wood and some foliage, looking quite out of place.
> "Not many adventurers enter here every day, but it's unlikely this trap was here for long. Someone doesn't want outsiders" says Gultag.  
> They both go past the trap, slightly opening the door to peek inside.

> [!NOTE] Checks
> PUM location:  
> Is protected by some faction.  
> Looking for answers.  
> Reason: Noise/Sound  
> What are the two factions here? Sandbox Generator says: Wererats & Orcs.  
> Did we found Orcs? Weak yes
> I will use this Reaction Table I found online (can't remember where!)  
> ![2D Reaction Table.png](/img/user/z_Attachments/2D%20Reaction%20Table.png)  
> Result: Willing to talk.

What are they searching for?  
Why are the wererats rare?  
Why is this place called Hellish Burrow?
