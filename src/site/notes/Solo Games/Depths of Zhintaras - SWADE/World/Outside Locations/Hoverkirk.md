Hoverkirk is a medium sized town of recent foundation. It was a nameless hamlet of low importance in the middle of nowhere, until the discovery of the Depths of Zhintaras entrance in the so-called Hellish Burrow.
This attracted the attention of the local kingdom and that of the [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Factions/Arcane Protectors\|Arcane Protectors]], a powerful guild of arcane researchers.

Soon, the hamlet was renamed Hoverkirk, a non-official name from the hovering temple of the [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Factions/Arcane Protectors\|Arcane Protectors]], that watches from high in the air both the town and the entrance to The Depths. Today, adventurers are starting to explore the dangerous depths, after the [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Factions/Arcane Protectors\|Arcane Protectors]] gave the permission to quicken the structure exploration (and lower internal casualities).

With time, the overrall extension of the Depths of Zhintaras has become known thanks to some scrying incantations, but only the most surface-level investigation can work, leaving everyone puzzled to the origin of this megadungeon.
