A trio of [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Factions/Arcane Protectors\|Arcane Protectors]], encountered the first time in F1-5, while busy collecting the healing honey of [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Megadungeon/F1 Hellish Burrow/Creatures/Delkeheal\|Delkeheal]]'s hive.

They seem friendly enough and encouraging towards new adventurers.

A skinny and tall elf with short hairs and reading glasses, giving him a very academic and precision-driven look.
A knight covered in armor, nothing can be seen. From the voice, a masculine sound comes out.
The other is a human with short black hairs and a newer robe. Has not spoken yet.
