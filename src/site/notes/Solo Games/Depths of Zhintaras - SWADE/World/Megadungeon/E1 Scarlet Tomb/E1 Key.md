# History
Long ago, the Tomb was built by the **Scarlet Order**, a religious order of the **Scarlet God of Blood and Flowing Life**.
Here the clerics of the Order were interred after a life of service.
After many years of service, an invading Kobold clan caused a terrible curse to be unleashed on the structure, causing an explosive growth of blood red vegetation. The red colour is given by the blood flowing in place of the chlorophyl.

## Recent events
Recently, the Scarlet Order has been eliminated or severely weakened, leaving control of the level to the Kobolds, who continue to live with the cursed vegetation.

# General features
Old walls, almost completely covered in vegetation, both arboreal and fungal.
Roots peek from the ceiling, covering it and providing some holes from where light can pass. (20% chance of room being lit during the day).
The place is completely dark, denizens either rely on darkvision or the use of torches.
Humidity and the smell of death permeates the place.

# Keys

A place haunted by the remnants of the Scarlet Order. Unknown exact position at the moment, but the Kobolds avoid the Temple and would love to have it cleaned up.
