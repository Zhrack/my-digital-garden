TODO 
- [x] Roll for treasure, check FORGE what's available or Fantasy Companion or SG.
- [x] Also ask oracle if there is a passage to the other level. The bandits came from there.
- [ ] Update PC sheets to use FC stuff. Cleric is missing powers. Also check in detail Arcana chapter for trappings, activations etc.
- [ ] Use Gold&Glory Advancement and Encoumbrance system.
    - [ ] Each expedition will require a round of Downtime after. News Feed of town is advanced at that time.
- [x] For next dungeon, use Gold&Glory random system to detailed dungeon rooms and content.
- [ ] When exploring, use the standard room content table in Sandbox Generator, then use PUM/SUM/GUM to actually inspire content. This should avoid having all random rooms, instead following a bit the treasure/monster/empty/special format.
    - [ ] If it's still too generic, I could further specialize Special to be a type of challenge, based on Alexandrian Dungeon design.
    - [ ] Monster can lead to combat or social challenges.
    - [ ] Empty is lore and world building.
    - [ ] Treasure is treasure
    - [ ] Special can be all other challenges, to be rolled randomly on Alexandrian [[Workflow & Inspiration/Alexandrian Prep/Design a Dungeon\|Design a Dungeon]]
