[[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Drukmor.excalidraw\|Drukmor.excalidraw]] and [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Gultag.excalidraw\|Gultag.excalidraw]] have entered the first room in this megadungeon, immediately finding a group of Orcs searching for something.
> [!NOTE]- Checks
> How many orcs? Handful. 3 Orcs  
> Do they speak Common? No

> They seem surprised to find the adventurers but don't react aggressively, waiting for a reaction from them.  
> Drukmor: "Please we are just passing through, we don't want issues."  
> The orcs look puzzled, showing the language barrier.  
> Drukmor, after a moment of thinking, gestures toward the next door.

Wait... How many doors are here?  
> [!NOTE]- Checks
> Sandbox Generator:  
> 3 other doors.  
> 2 are stuck, the other is a locked metal door. According to SG, a locked metal door can be opened only by a thief or by a key. We have neither, ofc!

> Were the orcs investigating a door? Yes  
> I would say, they are trying to open the metal door.  
> Since the other two doors are stuck, they couldn't come from there. They were thrown out of the metal door, before being closed and are trying to open it.

> Drukmor notices their interest in the door and gestures the opening action.  
> The orcs responds by trying to open it with a metal bar, acting as an improvised crowbar, but without success. Then the leader of them gesture for help and in giving them a map of the other side.  
> The adventurers think about it for a moment, before accepting the agreement.  
> Gultag has a crowbar. He will try to pry the door open. Maybe it will be enough.

> [!NOTE]-
> 
> The crowbar enables the action, so no bonus or malus to it.
> Gultag: Athletics 7, 3. Success.

> Gultag manages to pry it open, making a loud breaking noise.

This noise will trigger an encounter check, together with another one for the time spent in the encounter. Time to build one!

> It's staggered in terms of probability to have a dominant faction. The empty ones will be filled up when encountering them, choosing external creatures.  
> Rolled:
> 3. Wererats.  
> 7. New creature!  
> Let's ask GUM: Flesh, putrid, undead, scary, zombie, life-mimic.  
> Seems like some good ol' zombies are on order! These are probably the rare creature that are taking over, not the Wererats. "Undead" added as a third entry.  
> Killed foes raise again as zombies, so that's why they are taking over.

We are encountering some Wererats and some Undeads. 
Time to generate what's on the other side and what's inside! A fourth creature type maybe? :D

Quick session today!
