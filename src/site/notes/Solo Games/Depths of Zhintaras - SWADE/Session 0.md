# What is Depths of Zhintaras?
This is my attempt at playing a OSR-style megadungeon using Savage Worlds Adventure Edition.

## Yes, but where does the name Zhintaras come from?

Sounded cool, so we have a winner!

# What am I using to play? 

Here is a list, might change with time.
- Savage Worlds Adventure Edition
- Sandbox Generator (https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/430675/sandbox-generator) for the general layout and room by room generation of the locations.
- Spectacular Settlements (https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/309046/spectacular-settlements-system-neutral) for the surface town.
- Mythic's News Feeds (https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/460363/Mythic-Magazine-Volume-35) to injects events in each level and area of the dungeon.
- SWADE Fantasy Companion. I have it, seems like a good moment to use it :)
- Plot Unfolding Machine (https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/457293/plot-unfolding-machine) for Oracle and general solo aid
- Scene Unfolding Machine (https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/463701/scene-unfolding-machine) mainly for NPC emulation.
- Game Unfolding Machine (https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/449739/game-unfolding-machine-v2) for more solo aid and generators.
- Probably other tools depending on mood.

# How will you play?
My idea is to generate a town (or better, reuse the one I had created in a previous SWADE campaign) to be the base for all expeditions and try to explore the actual megadungeon.

I generated the cross section with Sandbox Generator, here is the current situation.

I rolled 6 on which entrance to start from, so only the entrance in Hellish Burrow is known, the others will be considered unknown and will need to be found.

I will use Sandbox Generator's structure generation rule to generate room by room on the fly and use that book to generate the content of each room.

I will also tick the time and check for random encounters and torches. Logistical problems will be a major source of problems for my PCs, as is OSR tradition.

Combat will probably be made in FoundryVTT, where I have the official material. Detailed mapping will be done either there or in Excalidraw, I'll use the easiest to pickup. Some TotM combat will also happen.

# Why SWADE for a OSR game?
I wanted to try SWADE, so here we are.
I also think that playing with OSR principles doesn't require a OSR old school game.
I will starting with the following Setting Rules:

![Pasted image 20240127001509.png](/img/user/z_Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240127001509.png)

and I will adjust them as needed. I expect for the game to be less lethal than OSR games, but the lethality is what I like less about OSR, so I'm not missing anything. I'm aiming for a middle ground between OSR games like Old-School Essentials and Basic Fantasy RPG, and heroic games like D&D 5e.

Benny side, I will keep track of them for each PC separately.

# Who are the PCs?
Here as well I will reuse both PCs I had in a previous campaign, the Dwarf Cleric Drukmor and the Human Fallen Knight Gultag.

## Drukmor
Background:
A Healer, cleric of [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Religions/Tramadir\|Tramadir]], dwarven god of healing and protection.
Has worked in dwarven cities and temples for years, but has now decided that it's time to act on the protection commandments of Tramadir, so he started adventuring into the world. His main drive is getting rid of abominations like undeads and recently many of them have been seen coming from Zhintaras.

Personality:
Rough and humorous, especially towards other races, even if never disrespectful. Just tries to show that dwarves can be talkative and light hearted, contrary to popular belief, sometimes overdoing it.

## Gultag
Background:
Gultag was the founder of a mercenary company that specialized in protection services as bodyguards.
After a few years of work, his company had gained a good reputation, getting hired to protect the son of a influential nobleman.
Due to unprecise information and a sudden ambush, some attackers managed to kill the boy.
The nobleman, as revenge, proceeded to destroy the company's name and Gultag's name
in the process.
He started doing adventuring work and odd jobs to get by and capitalize on his
martial training and experience. Zhintaras may be a place to find glory and clean his name?

![Gultag.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Gultag.png)

Personality:
He is a pretty serious person usually, mostly seeing the bad angle of most things.
He is confident, often too much, in his abilities, which he expects to be the means to regain his lost reputation.
He leaves the talking to Drukmor usually, trying to avoid exposing himself and letting his
reputation get in the way of his new job.
