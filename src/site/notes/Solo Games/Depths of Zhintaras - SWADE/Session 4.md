In last session, we found that this area has [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/World Elements/Blood Rust\|Blood Rust]], a force or entity that ruins equipment if left unchecked. We lost a lot of fuel and an entire lantern to this.
We still have various hours of light if needed, but who knows what might be damaged next.

These are the plot nodes at the moment:
![Pasted image 20240130232030.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240130232030.png)


> Once opening up, the duo sees a long corridor ahead of them. The light of the lantern doesn't shine enough, so the end is not visible.
> On the right, two rusty metal doors are closed.
> Both of them try to examine them both for traps and for noises on the other side.

> [!NOTE]-
> First the check for traps. I would say, Thievery check. Both are not skilled at this.
> Drukmor: 1, 2. Fail.
> Gultag: 5, 3. Success.
> Is there a trap? No. DD: 4.
> 
> Perception now, with Notice:
> Drukmor: 4, 4. Success.
> Gultag: 10, 8. Success with raise.
> What do they hear? Sense: Imagine a future, a vision. Focus: Faith/Divine.
> 
> Now, doing all of this will require some time, so time to tick the time!
> d8: 2. Nothing.

> Each of them work on a different door. After examining all recesses and assessing the lack of danger, they both stay for a couple of minutes with their ears at the door, listening.
> After a bit, they sense a chant coming from the other side, as if a group of voices were singing a ritual for a religious theme.

> [!NOTE]-
> I think they are going to open the door to peek inside and see what's the situation.
> Let's check for a modified proposal: Increase intensity, tension, drama.
> How? It was all part of the plan. DD: 4.
> Focus: Key/Doors.
> What is the door doing? Activity: Having a fight or attacking. DD: 1. Random Prompt!
> Unfavorable prompt (roll twice and pick lowest), given the door attacking: Handle a meaningful encounter.

> Let's see: 10. [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Factions/Arcane Protectors\|Arcane Protectors]]!
> Perfectly aligned, the AP are magical researchers but have a religious relationship with the Sacred Crystal they study.
> How many are there? As expected. DD: 3. I think 3 would be a good amount. A knight protecting two mages.
> What are they doing? Looking for some answers. DD: 7 
> 2D Reaction roll: 7, 7. Curious about the party.

> While Gultag is investigating the door, he sees what seems to be the pommel turning into a mouth full of teeths. 
> It tries to attack the exposed hand of Gultag.

> [!NOTE]-
> d6 fighting for the animated door. 2. Fail.

> Gultag moves away the hand at the last time, hearing a beastly growling coming from the door itself.
> After a moment, it freezes, turning back to a rigid object and slowly opening, showing three individuals.
> All are wearing the symbol of the Arcane Protectors and are ready to fight, two robed people, Arcanists, behind a Mage Knight, in full armor.
> Even if ready, they still seem calm and composed.
> "For a moment we thought you were local denizens, instead we find adventurers on expedition. May we have your name?" says one of the mages, a skinny and tall elf with short hairs and reading glasses, giving him a very academic and precision-driven look.

> [!NOTE]-
> What else if in the room? Is very busy/crowded/swarmed. 
> Focus: Arrival/Birth
> Objects? Restores/empowers energy/stamina

> While saying so, the three Protectors have behind them what seems like a giant beehive, grown covering a corner of the room.
> Around it, a swarm of small flying insects, with a red glowing body, is on high alert, to protect the beehive and the red honey-like substance that drips from it, causing a puddle on the ground.
> 
> Noticing the curious look of the duo, the elf says: "These are [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Megadungeon/F1 Hellish Burrow/Creatures/Delkeheal\|Delkeheal]], strange you don't know about them. We are trying to collect the red honey for [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Outside Locations/Hoverkirk\|Hoverkirk]], they have healing properties if consumed. Since you seem new arrivals, we can let you collect some for yourself, if you manage."

> [!NOTE]-
> Do the others agree in giving free healing potions? Let's ask SUM. 
> Opinion: Warn or advice against it, but without opposing.
> 

> The knight, covered under his helm: "They are going to be wounded and we are going to babysit them out of here, don't waste time...". His tone is not super convincing, as if he was half curious to see the innocent adventurers getting their first dose of the Depths.
> 
> Drukmor responds: "I see you are experts, so we will gladly accept your advice in gathering the honey. We will probably need it, we are not three after all...".
> 
> Drukmor brings Gultag closer to the hive, with the Three Protectors making way, hoping for an amusing scene.

> [!NOTE]-
> Do they notice anything helpful form the insect's behavior?
> Notice check.
> Drukmor: d6. 5, 1. Success.
> Gultag: d6. 3, 1. Fail.
> 
> What do they notice?
> Discovery: Reveal a conspiracy. DD: 8.
> Focus: Forces/Army
> How: Had to make a hard choice

> While examining the hive, Drukmor notices that the insects seem to invite the prey to the hive, yet they fly with the exposed sting.
> 
> Drukmor takes a ration and checks if they are in any way attracted by the smell of it.

> [!NOTE]-
> Are they interested? Unlikely. Yes, and hurry up. DD: 7.

> Upon swinging the food around, the flying swarm seems attracted yet hesitant to leave the hive exposed.
> Drukmor throws the food near the hive, on the ground. The swarm immediately envelopes the ration, covering it while some sting it, others start to take pieces and bringing them to the Queen.
> 
> Quicky, Gultag takes a couple of small bottles and put them under the dripping honey, quickly filling it up.

> [!NOTE]-
> Two healing potions, one for each.
> 
> Do the [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/NPCs/Three Protectors\|Three Protectors]] congratulate? Strong yes

> The trio starts to congratulate enthusiastically after both of them leave the hive with the two filled bottles. The knight claps his hands slowly, in sign of respect.
> 
> "Seems like you could learn your way around here, sooner then expected." says the elf.

> [!NOTE]-
> 
> Time ticked while doing this.
> Encounter check: 4. Nothing.
> Ticked resources.

> "We need to continue collecting the honey for today, maybe we will meet again. An advice, better to avoid too much noise here. Orcs and wererats inhabit this place. While reasonable, they sometimes can get impatient or nervous at the view of strangers, so always be careful."
> 
> Said that, the duo is greeted away without too many ceremonies, finding themselves outside the room and into the dark corridor again.
> A small moment of respite that flees rapidly.

It might be time to keep track of the rooms. Here is the Map key for F1: [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Megadungeon/F1 Hellish Burrow/F1 Key\|F1 Key]].
