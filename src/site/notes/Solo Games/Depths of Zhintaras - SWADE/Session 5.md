Last session, I forgot to give more time to the interaction with the [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/NPCs/Three Protectors\|Three Protectors]]. Next time, I will try to interact more, though the clock of encounter checks is ticking! Better hurry!

Now I also gave a face to both of the PCs! (AI art warning)
Here is Gultag:
![Gultag.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Gultag.png)

and here is Drukmor:
![Drukmor.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Drukmor.png)

Images have been added to the [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/Session 0\|Session 0]], where they were presented the first time too.

> After closing the door behind them, they hear arcane mutterings and after a few seconds, the door again animates, ready to assault any intruder.
> Gultag: "Might be a good idea to find a mage to accompany us next time, if they can do these fancy tricks..."
> Drukmor simply responds with a "Aye"
> Then they continue down the corridor.

> [!NOTE]-
> Current section they are in:
> ![Pasted image 20240206232855.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240206232855.png)
> Do they notice the hidden door? Notice Check.
> Drukmor: d6, d6. 4, 4. Success.
> Gultag: d6, d6. 5, 2. Success.
> 
> SG: Door camouflage & clue.
> Same as the wall & clue related to appearence.
> Appearence: gloomy, historic/quaint
> 
> Door shape: Octagon
> Room type: Empty, no treasure.
> Has the room already been plundered of whatever it was hidden? Yes. DD: No disruption.
> PUM Modified proposal: Make the location more favorable.
> What can be favorable?
> Discovery: Get ahead of their plans.
> Focus: Forces/Army
> How? An accident, a side effect. 
> DD: No disruption.
> GUM Object oracle: Emit sound, music, alarm, resonance

> While walking through the corridor, they notice a patch of strangely dense moss. While checking, they discover a secret door shaped like the natural rock wall. They check for traps but nothing can be found, so they enter, Gultag first.
> 
> They find a roughly octagonal room, with what seems to be an armoury of the orcs. Before they can even start to look at the equipment stored, their eye is attracted to a small table near a wall, with some paper notes on it.

> [!NOTE]-
> Is it in orcish? Likely. Strong yes
> DD: No disruption.
> Language check to understand something. Both are untrained but only Drukmor tries it.
> Gultag instead spends the time searching the armoury for something good. 
> Drukmor Languages check: d2, d6. 1, 5. Success.
> Gultag Notice check: d6, d6. 1, 3. Fail. Benny. 10, 1. Succes with raise.
> Since it's with raise, among the normal weapons and equipment, there are two high quality items.
> Armor, Weapon, Magical object, Tool. d4 to choose.
> 4, 1. Tool and Armor.
> Is the armor useful to Gultag? Weak yes. Rolling on the Fantasy Companion for the special material, I got Adamantine. So it's Adamantine chainmail, ignoring 2 points of AP and has Hardness +4.
> Now the tool. What is it?
> GUM Object: Poison, immobilize, trap, hinder.
> Rolling on the Fantasy Companion poison list: Goblin Poison. If ingested, dulls agility, decreasing all Trait checks 1 die type for 30 mins.
> I would say that there are other d6 mundane armor or weapons: 5. I would say, 3 great axes and 2 mauls, might do a good loot.
> 
> Encounter check while searching: 6. No.

> Drukmor takes the poison, Gultag the armor, which he doesn't wear immediately to not be recognized as a thief.
> 
> Drukmor in the meantime manages to understand some of the scribbles, from which he understood them being a rough sketch of the alarm procedure and other patrolling information regarding the orcs.
> "This could be of interest for the wererats, if they are nice." says Drukmor with a complicit smile.
> 
> After that, both leave the armoury and continue along the corridor, reaching the turn and seeing an old door on the right, just after seeing the long corridor continuing in the dark.

> [!NOTE]-
> We are near the Orc Main Hall, it would make sense to encounter someone.
> Is there anyone in the corridor ahead? 50/50. Yes.
> Let's check the [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Megadungeon/F1 Hellish Burrow/F1 Random Encounter Table\|F1 Random Encounter Table]]. 1! Wererats.
> I guess they both see each other, as Gultag is carrying a lantern.
> ![2D Reaction Table.png](/img/user/z_Attachments/2D%20Reaction%20Table.png)
> 8, 9. Wants to barter.
> What do they want to barter? GUM subject: Agreement, a contract, an alliance, arrangement, deal.
> Interesting.
> How many are there? I expect 2d4. 
> PUM quantity: Way more than expected. 4d4 then! 8 total.

> When turning the corner, they see this group of wererats. Immediately recognizable by the small size, the rat-like appearance and the long tails. They are wearing some simple leather vestments, not exactly armour.
> They are checking around a spot on the wall on the left, seemingly the same as any other spot on the roots-infested walls.
> The rats get illuminated by the lantern light. Initially on alert, as if being found in an hostile territory, they slightly relax when they recognize outsiders, not orcs.
> ![wererats.jpg](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/wererats.jpg)
> One of them speaks up after a moment, wearing some old adventurer's clothes.
> "Ah, you startled us, tsk! Thought we were found by the orcs!
> Quick, you help us finding the hidden door, we share some treasure with you, tsk. Might even help you while you explore. 
> No need to be surprised, all outsiders want to find treasures and knowledge in the Depths, you are no different. We live here since a long time, the orcs came after and stole this section.
> If you help us, we will be friends and will provide, tsk!
> Now, the first thing you can help us with is searching around here for the passage or door, they excavated one, the rats told us."

> [!NOTE]-
> Since both of the adventurers have the information that they wanted to sell, I think they will help them as a quick way to improve relations.
> Notice Check:
> Drukmor: d6, d6. 3, 2. Fail.
> Gultag: d6, d6. 4, 5. Success.
> This will require some time, so encounter check. 5. Nothing.

> "Of course we can help, always good to have friends." says Drukmor.
> 
> After searching for a few minutes, Gultag finds an opening behind a thick group of roots and rocks.

> [!NOTE]-
> **Room type**: Special.
> The Special table in Sandbox Generator is a bit too random and out of place after several rolls.
> For the next rooms I might use other systems instead, like FORGE, a very nice modern OSR game (https://zap-forge.itch.io/forge).
> I will interpret this as a Discovery. Even if I will continue using Sandbox Generator or other similar systems to generate the detailed layout, stocking will be in FORGE.
> 
> FORGE Discovery in a Unique area, since it was hidden:
> **Discovery**: Feature -> Structure -> Pillars or columns.
> **Unique area** (Faction base): Vault.
> So it seems that FORGE confirms what I was thinking.
> I'll roll for the treasure later, since it's a vault.
> 
> Is the area trapped? Likely. PUM: Weak yes.
> DD: 1! Random prompt: Handle a meaningful encounter.
> ![Pasted image 20240209192738.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240209192738.png)
> d20: 1! Adventurers! 
> 
> **Adventurers**
> Are the Adventurers the trappers? Likely. Yes.
> Why are they here?
> GUM Faction driving focus: Restoration: Come back to their former glory, order, and restore the balance.
> GUM Action: Strengthen, empower, reinforce, fortify, improve.
> GUM Adjective: Foolish, dumb, unprepared, unprotected, vulnerable
> GUM Subject: Ability, quality, power, edge, implant, skill, maneuver
> How many? Expect 4d4 like the wererats. PUM: Way less than expected. 2d4. 5.
> 
> **Trap**:
> I guess the adventurers are the trap...
> Does our duo notice them?
> Notice Check:
> Drukmor: d6, d6. 4, 2. Success.
> Gultag: d6, d6. 4, 2. Success.
> 
> Do the wererats notice?
> Notice check with a Wild Die, since it's a group roll. I guess they have d6.
> Wererats: d6, d6. 20, 1. Wow. Success with 3 raises.

> As soon as the first couple wererats enters the room, followed by Drukmor and Gultag, they enter a smaller room than the previous, still excavated in the earth and with some crude pillars made of wood helping bearing the load.
> There is some light coming from some torches, which are the first clue of the presence of someone else.
> D&G, together with most of the wererats inside, immediately notices some movent behind the pillars, covering behind the last two pillars for cover.
> 
> Immediately after, an arrow goes straight into the chest of one of the wererats, hitting the ground.
> A group of people can be seen on the other side, armed with short bows and short swords. They were waiting for them!

> [!NOTE]-
> First fight! I'll do it in FoundryVTT.
> Here is the setup:
> ![Pasted image 20240209232030.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240209232030.png)
> 
> I'll do group rolls for both groups, since otherwise it will be too long.
> I'll use the Bandit stat block for the adventurers and the Common Ratling for the wererats.
> 
> #### **Round 1**
> 
> ![Pasted image 20240209232052.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240209232052.png)
> - **Gultag** runs to the closest bandit and attacks, swinging and hitting only the air.
> - **Drukmor** moves into position where Gultag was, peeking from behind the column and casting a bolt of divine light towards the same adventurer that is fighting with Gultag, hitting them in the chest, shaking them.
> - **Wererats**: Three of them attack the other nearest adventurer, hitting them and killing them on the spot. The others move inside the room and take cover as they can.
> - **Adventurers**: The three remaining shoot their bows, missing all the wererats nearby in the chaos of the melee. The shaken one fails the roll.
> ![Pasted image 20240210000527.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240210000527.png)
> 
> #### **Round 2
> 
> ![Pasted image 20240210000550.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240210000550.png)
> - **Wererats**: Having killed one, the three wererats immediately focus on the archers, blocking their dangerous bows. They all claw each one of them, shaking them.
> - **Adventurers**: They all recover from being shaken. They try to respond to the attack with their swords, failing in hitting anyone.
>     - Here, a morale check would be in order. While FORGE has rules for this, the bestiary of SWADE doesn't have a morale value, so I guess I'll need to use the Fear rules for it.
>     - Fear check: Spirit roll as group roll. 17, 2. Fight on!
> - **Drukmor**: Drukmor decides to put some good ideas in the head of the adventurer near Gultag, using the staff. He manages to hit him, also thanks to the support of Gultag and another wererat, but the blow is amortized by the clothing, doing minimal damage. "Stop the attack, for [[Solo Games/Depths of Zhintaras - SWADE/World/Religions/Tramadir\|Tramadir]]!"
> - **Gultag**: He doesn't care. Self-defense is self-defense. He attacks for 21, dealing increased damage! His axe plants itself in the adventurer's head. Gultag then pushes the stuck corpse with his boot, freeing the weapon.
> 
> ![Pasted image 20240210002827.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240210002827.png)
> 
> #### **Round 3
> 
> ![Pasted image 20240210002845.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240210002845.png)
> - **Drukmor**: Drukmor sees the other wererats swarming the three remaining people, waiting for an opening (holding)
> - **Wererats**: They all try to attack, as needed, but the fight seem to keep longer.
> - **Adventurers**: Morale check: Success. They all attack the wererats near them, missing as well.
> - **Drukmor**: He decides to act, casting another bolt of light toward one of them. He manages to invoke the energy, casting a very concentrated one and doing 27 damage! The body of the adventurer disappears. "As long as you continue attacking unprompted like this, I'll continue defending us. Fear the lovingly hand when it's betrayed!"
> - **Gultag**: Gultag reaches the other, decapitating him with a swift swing.
> 
> ![Pasted image 20240210003940.png](/img/user/Solo%20Games/Depths%20of%20Zhintaras%20-%20SWADE/_att/Pasted%20image%2020240210003940.png)
> 
> Fear check: Failed.
> The last adventurer drops his weapons and raising his hands.
> 
> The combat has finished.

Why did they attack? Where do they come from?
We'll know next session!
