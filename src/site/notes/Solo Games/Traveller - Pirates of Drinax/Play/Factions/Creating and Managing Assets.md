Assets are individuals or groups that can provide assistance and information. Using them costs resources or a favour.

Each have a Asset Die, like for [[Workflow & Inspiration/Faction System/Coterie Faction System\|Coterie Faction System]].
PC's Assets are Assets of PCs' Faction.
# Creating a new Asset
A simple contact can be found by making a **Average 8+ Streetwise  check**.
On success, an Asset with AC equal to 0 is created.
# Improving Asset relationship

# Requesting Assistance
Other factions use the [[Workflow & Inspiration/Faction System/Coterie Faction System\|Coterie Faction System]]. PCs' Assets use these rules.

# Asset Network
An Asset with AC 12+ can work for the PCs to create and improve relationships with other Assets, creating a network. Register that on [[Solo Games/Traveller - Pirates of Drinax/Play/Asset Networks.excalidraw\|Asset Networks.excalidraw]].

# One-off requests
Cost 1Dx1000 Cr x minimum AC required to carry out request.
This is done with coercion, persuasion or bribes, but final cost is the same. Asset might become unavailable to be friends afterwards, depending on narrative justification.
