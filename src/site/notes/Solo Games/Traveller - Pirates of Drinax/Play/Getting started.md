		- [x] probably the piracy rules are cool, to manage heat
		- [ ] improvement rules of Harrier, page 59
		- [ ] Run the First Prize mini adventure, page 90
		- [ ] Many of the rules can be winged as needed, like "cleaning up" a stolen ship. Instead of all that mess, just roll 1D weeks to do it. A roll can speed up or slow down the work, but it's always a success.
		- [ ] Assets & Factions, page 11
		- [ ] Courting Assets, page 12

		- [ ] Create safe bases around the place to lay low
		- [ ] Try to make a small fleet for cargo runs etc... Harrier is very visible
