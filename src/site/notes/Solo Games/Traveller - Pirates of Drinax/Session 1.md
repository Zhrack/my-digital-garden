# Intro
This is an attempt at playing a solo campaign of Pirates of Drinax, a sandbox campaign for Mongoose Traveller 2e.
I’ll be using Mythic 2e with the Traveller rules. Since Traveller is quite modular, I will be keeping things on the leaner side to simplify bookkeeping.

In this campaign, the party of 4 PCs are recruited by King Oleb of the system Drinax, asking them to become privateers for him to try and influence nearby systems to join his kingdom, once covering a vast area of the Trojan Reach sector.
No guidance is given in how to achieve this, but the King provides free use of the Harrier ship. An ancient spacecraft from the destruction of the Drinax planet, 200 years prior, which has seen better days but it’s still functional despite some broken systems.
Now the King reigns from his high tech orbital palace, overseeing his radioactive planet and trying to come out of the irrelevance that the Aslan Hierate condemned them when they bombarded the planet 200 years ago.
Drinax and other nearby systems are in a free space between the Aslan Hierate and the enormous Third Imperium.

In this situation, our PCs start moving.
They can be traders, pirates, heroes and villains.
The objective is winning the favour of other systems to recreate the once great Drinaxian Empire.
Or should they? Maybe for now…

We have the 4 PCs:
- William Adams: a human with a preexisting career in University, then the Navy as Engineer, reaching the grade of Sublieutenant. After retiring, he started working for the Scouts, an organization tasked with exploring and surveying the galaxy.
- Jake Moore: a human who tried to enter in the Army Academy and his poverty forced him to seek pirating. After a long career full of heists, he finally gets imprisoned during a botched job. He just came out.
- Tagon: an Aslan artist. This lion-like creature comes from a good family of nobility and passed most of his life as a socialite and made a name of himself as a writer of a certain success. After getting bored, he used his connections to land a job in Administration, where he made numerous friends. He was on Drinax and got involved for mere curiosity.
- Irthur: a Vargr full of resources. This worlf-like creature started as a free trader after failing entry to the Marines Academy. He soon lost everything and got drafted in the Army in a support role. For several years he successfully worked there, learning a lot, especially in medicine and electronics. After reaching a good pension, he mustered out to finally start his own thing, with the help of the others.

All of them know each other from the various events.

# Session 1

> [!Rolls]-
> CF: 5
> We already have a mission. We could start by going to the nearest systems.
> We have Asim and Pourne next door.
> Asim has UWP B867564-6 and trade codes Ag Ni Ga O:2324, PBG 205.
> Let’s translate this.
> B: Good starport. Berthing cost 500 cr, refined fuel available 500/ton. Shipyard and repairs.
> Size 8: standard Earth sized
> 6: standard atmosphere
> 7: around 70% water coverage
> 5: population 10^5. Around 100k to 1M inhabitants
> 6: Gov: Captive government. It’s a colony of Drinax.
> 4: Law level. Banned weapons are military and light assault weapons. No Cloth armor or better. Looks like we need to go without armor or risk it.
> 6: Tech level. Kinda around beginning of 1900 level.
> Ag: Agricultural
> Ni: Non-Industrial
> Ga: Garden
> No idea about O, can’t find it.
> P: Pop multiplier, so 200k inhabitants
> B: Bases, nothing.
> G: 5 gas giants
>
> Pourne has UWP A9B2887-A and trade codes Fl He Ph, PBG 902
> A: Excellent starport. 1k cr berthing, refined fuel, shipyard for everything.
> 9: Size: Big planet, 1.25g
> B: atmosphere. Corrosive, need vacc suit.
> 2: around 20% water. Small seas.
> 8: pop 10^8. 100M inhabitants. 900M inhabitants counting the P.
> 8: Gov type. Civil service Bureaucracy.
> 7: law level; Banned all firing weapons, melee permitted. No visible armor.
> A: Tech level 10. Quite advanced, but not too much.
> Fl: Fluid oceans. He and Ph not present in book, so probably different version of Traveller.
> No bases, 2 gas giants.
>
> Asim is already a colony of Drinax, the only one actually. So Pourne seems like a good first step. Even if corrosive, it provides with an industrial base and can be a good commercial partner.

According to the books, Pourne is governed by a paranoid bureaucratic caste that assumes all offworlders to be saboteurs, probably. There are high planetary defenses and the starport in orbit is governed with aggressive guards. The place remains a trade hub thanks to its stability and tech level. Nice place.

I could try to recruit some crew to man the ship, but we are broke, so better not risk mutinies or people going away.

> [!Rolls]
> To learn the rules, I will try to do some passenger carrying from Drinax to Pourne, to raise some easy money.
> We have 8 staterooms, 4 available and 8 low berths. There are enough in Drinax going to Pourne to fill the ship, so I’ll need to turn some away.
> Tagon Broker skill check plus modifiers from Drinax and Pourne population levels and starport level give a total of DM5 to the roll.
> 4 Middle class is 6.5k each. So 26k.
> 8 low berths are 700 each. So 5.6k.
> Let’s roll how many frozen passengers survive the trip:
> Medicine Routine 6+ check for each. +1 due to the ship being high TL.
> Done by Ithur, our medic with Medicine 3. All succeed.
> The passengers should cover this month’s maintenance costs of 28k.
> Regarding cash, luckily none of the PCs starts with any debt, so we are at 182k with this new revenue.
> Let’s fill the cargo with some easy freight. We have 29 tons available.
> We roll for availability of Major Lot, Minor Lot and Incidental Lot.
> Major Lot:
> - Effect of 8+ Broker or Streetwise. Tagon again. 7, Effect -1.
> - Major Lot DM-4
> - For Drinax DM-4 due to low population, +4 for high population of Pourne, so 0 total.
> - Both have A starports, so DM+2 each. +4
> - Both TL10+, so DM+2 each. +4.
> Roll 5 + 3=8. 3D lots. 7 lots available. Each is 1Dx10 tons. To keep rolling low, I’ll get the average at 3, so 30 tons. Can’t bring any of them.
> Minor Lot:
> 15 tons each.
> Same rolls of before.
> Tagon roll: 9. Effect 1.
> DM+9 total. 5D available. 15. I can bring only 1 at 15 tons.
> Incidental Lot:
> 3 tons each.
> Togan roll: 10. Effect 2.
> DM+12 total thanks to Incidental DM+2. 29 lots
> Another possible source of income is Mail delivery, which each container is 5 tons flat and brings 25k for each. There are 1D containers and all or nothing can be brough. Rolled 4, so 20 tons of mail for 100k. Easy win instead of cargo.
> Since this is 1 jump, freight brings 1k per ton. Freight is profitable for a small ship like mine only for a travel of at least 6 jumps.
> I will load the mail and 9 tons of incidental cargo, for 100k + 9k of profit.

So if we arrive at Pourne, 109k will wait for us. Didn’t expect cargo to scale so poorly compared to mail. Haven’t tried yet smuggling and speculative trading. Next time. At least I learned now that maintenance of ship and eventual crew is not going to be a big issue.

> [!Rolls]
> Now to make the jump. I will not test for random stuff, I want to see the flow for now.
> Our newly mint privateers sail from the orbital palace and go to the edge of the system, where it’s safe to jump.
> Preparation of jump:
> Astrogation Easy 4+ check, with DM-1 being a 1 jump distance.
> Time for William. 2D + 2 Int + 2 Skill - 1 distance. 9. Success.
> Fuel consumption is 10% of tonnage x jump parsecs. In this case, we have a total of 42 tons. The Harrier is 200 tons, so 20 tons per parsec. 20 tons in this case.
> Each jumps requires 1 week, regardless of distance. Jumping means being in a temporary universe of a bubble of hydrogen, so we are completely alone.
> Since the jump was good, we will come out near the target world already.

During this week, each of the crew members will train on something, to be decided next session. Also once arrived, we will see the situation and what can be exploited for Drinax’s interest.

> [!Rolls]
> So, forgot to actually roll for the jump itself. It’s an Engineering(j drive) check, Easy 4+ modified by the Effect of the previous Astrogation check, which is 5. This is a Task Chain.
> William time again. 2D + 5 + Int skill (0) + Engineer (j-drive) (2). 13. This is a success with more than 6 Effect, so an exceptional success.
> In this case it’s just a good jump, so I would say that during travel the fuel consumption is better than expect, so I would say half of it.

> [!Rolls]
> At this point, I would say a new scene is in order.
> Jump went well, so CF4.
> Expected scene: Travellers arrive at Pourne to investigate for ways to increase approval of Drinax
> Check: 4. Expected.

Our travellers finally arrive near the highport of Pourne.
The satellite network of space cannons shows up on the scanners of the Harrier.

> [!Rolls]
> FQ: Are there issues on docking at highport? Nearly impossible.
> 9, 5. 9. No.

After a brief communication with the docks of the highport, access is granted to an available dock.
While docking, arrangements are made to discharge mails and passengers, hook up refueling to the Harrier (half cost to refill this time, so 5k).
After a bit, docking is complete, everyone discharges and workers arrive, taking the mail containers. The funds are all accredited.

So we are at the highport. What is like here?

> [!Rolls]
> Starship table: Inquire, Loud

While the passengers discharge, the group can see around them a busy highport, people and ships coming and going. Loudspeakers all around talk with a neutral and “corporate” voice, which is alternating between a feminine and a masculine one. The messages are all about keeping to himself, avoiding resistance to mandatory police checks. To ask for passage to planet-side, they remind everyone to follow the correct procedure to reach the public side of the capital. Failure to do so, will result in expedition to the penal colony on one of the gas giant moons.

I guess the group wants to gather information around before going down to the ground.

> [!NOTE]
> FQ: Do they find anything? Likely. 15. Yes
> So I guess a Streetwise or Carouse check, Average 8+ should suffice.
> Tagon time, Carouse. 6 + 1 skill + 2 SOC . 9. Success
> What do they find?
> Let’s use the Starport Encounters tables from Traveller.
> D66. 63. Government officials investigate the characters.
> Nice. So, they are not smuggling anything and the weapons are illegal only on planet-side, usually. I expect for this check to go smooth, but can give some talking points.

Since the Harrier is seen here for the first time, a routine control is made. A group of 2 guards approach them, asking some questions and to come onboard the ship.

> [!NOTE]
> Conversations: Meaningful, Plans
> Personality: Attain, Danger

The lead officer starts asking general information about the ship and the plans of the group while berthed. He has a very serious look, with a not so hidden distrust for them.

“We will be berthed for a few days before departing again. We are freelance traders and we resolve problems. Say, what is the procedure to reach the capital? We heard a lot of its beauty and we would love to visit.”, says Tagon.

> [!NOTE]
> Motivations table: Pleasure, Peace.
> I see where this is going. Let’s roll on a random mission on Traveller’s tables.
> Random Mission: 26. Sabotage a taget.
> Random Targets: 35. Bar or Nightclub.
> Random Opposition: 45. Target is in a dangerous region.
> Mmm.

The guard responds, behind his small moustache hiding a smirk.
“You wish to see the city? The procedure is simple, you prove that you are not a menace to Pourne, you can go down the public side.”

“I thought it was a… public place to go, y’ know.” Asks Jake.

”Not today” snaps back the guard. “You first need to help here on the station. If I say so, you can then go down.”. The guard is smiling.

“I have this spot the guards usually go to stretch after a long day’s work. Full of beautiful girls. But we go to keep an eye on the customers, it’s obvious. Thing is, one of our boys got carried away a couple of days ago and one of the girls felt really bad.
She couldn’t stomach some simple powder, you believe it? Ahahah”

“Anyway, my friend got in trouble for that while the girl is back to work, as if nothing happened. Only his career is ruined, suspended for 3 whole months without pay! The bitch gotta pay. You ruin her, you get to do your joyful trip down and get also some credits fo the disturb. Good luck entering the private part of the club though, security is tight. Are you on?” Looking at the group.

Tagon replies, with another smirk “Of course, bitches… gonna suffer” and he looks at his companions with a complicit look. The others, catching on the drift, confirm as well.

“Smart guys. The name’s Maeve Sullivan. Mine’s Edoth instead.”

After the guard goes away, Tagon says: “Going to fuck up that asshole. Let’s go talk with Maeve and see what she knows.”
Everyone starts walking in direction of the nightclub, no need to discuss.

Let’s end here for today.
I’ll make a new Mythic Adventure list for the Pourne System, to avoid mixing stuff.
