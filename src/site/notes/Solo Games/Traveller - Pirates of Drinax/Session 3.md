So… we have Jake, a man with a criminal past, arriving to a planet famous for considering every outsider a conspirator, who is found dabbling on a crime scene. Great first day.

> [!NOTE]
> Let’s see how the conversation with the guard goes.
> 

Jake is taken aback and doesn’t give much resistance to being brought on the ground by the guard, who handcuffs him behind his back.

> [!quote] Officer
> ”Identify yourself, outsider. What were you doing with the evidence?”

> [!quote] Jake
> Please Officer, we are just trying to help, we can explain.
> 

> [!Rolls]
> Persuade Difficult 10+. 2d6 + skill + SOC. 6. Fail.

The others don’t intervene to avoid complicating things.
Another guard arrives and he brings Jake away to the police post.
While going there, Jake tries to speak.

> [!Quote] Jake
> Officer, please, we are on the same side. We are working with Officer Edoth. If you don’t believe me, you can ask him.

> [!Rolls]
> FQ: Does the officer verify the claim? Likely. 12. Yes.

After doing a quick call check, the Officer looks at Jake with a hard look.

> [!Quote] Officer
> Saved at the edge it seems. Next time just ask for informations.
> Now let’s go back to your friends, we can talk there.

The duo returns to the nightclub’s entrance to the other guard interrogating the Travellers. The situation is immediately cleared and the guards share what they know of the stolen goods and the device.

> [!Rolls]
> FQ: Do they discover anything? Likely. 8. No.

The officers share the data on the retrieved device, which seems to be completely deleted by an internal short-circuit, probably a security means to avoid evidence.
A part for that, nothing else is present on the scene of any use.

Time to talk with the owner of the Nightclub.

> [!Note]
> Let’s see who is the owner.
> Characters Table: Feminine, Intense
> Appearance: Rough, Young
> Personality: Revenge, Loss
> Motivations: Suffering, Change
> Name: Shaan Bemah
> 
> Shaan is a prosperous young woman, with some dark curly hairs, left pretty wild and unkept.
> She has arrived at Pourne a few years ago after losing her partner to a revenge story in Clarke system. She is now trying to rebuild a life after moving here. She recently bought the nightclub.

The Travellers find Shaan inside, being helped by some workers of the nightclub in cleaning up the place.


> [!Rolls] 
> Locations: Fancy, Watery

The nightclub has had some extensive damage in part of it, thanks to a large quantity of water that have ruined the red velvet covered walls. A broken fish tank nearby reveal where the water comes from.

> [!Tagon]
> Hello madame, we are investigating the theft for Officer Edoth. May we ask some questions?

> [!Rolls]
> Initial Disposition Score: 11. Modifier +2.
> Action: 16+2. 18. Causes Harm.

When hearing the name of Edoth, she reacts by throwing a very bad look. 

> [!Shaan]
> Ah you are friends with him? Things keep getting better I see.
> Come in my office then. Samantha please continue to clean here.

She closes her door.

> [!Rolls]
> Simplified Behaviour Check: 11. NPC Continues +2. Since it's the first action, it's Context Action.
> Disp Score: 13.
> Vocal Behavior Meaning Table: Odd, Leadership.

> [!Shaan]
> What do you need? Other money? I already gave it to Edoth last week. I have the insurance company to call for the theft of today and...

> [!Tagon]
> What money? Madame, I think you misunderstood. We are friends and want to find the source of the theft. Why? Don't ask too much, but in the opinion of Edoth, we are his friends. But we don't consider him in such status.
> We have heard enough of this guy already to believe that he might be better doing a... less socially exposed job. If I were you, I would start collecting all the evidence of the money he requests, might come in handy soon...

> [!Rolls]
> NPC Action: 4. Talks, Exposition. Changing current context though.

> [!Shaan]
> So you are not working for him?
> If you want to ruin him, I'm all hears. With the recent drama with Maeve, our new girl, Edoth has become quite aggressive with us. His cops come here almost every day making bullshit claims of sanitary rules broken and other things. It's not even their area of competence!
> What do you want to know?

After the Travellers give a small rounddown of the missing evidence outside, they ask for any leads from her, regarding what the stolen machine can be used for and of any odd behaviour in the past days from anyone.

> [!Rolls]
> Discovery Check: Anything found? Likely. 20. Excep Yes. Roll twice.
> New Linked Clue and New Clue.
> Clue 1: Intense, Hard
> Clue 2: Investment, Odd

Clue 1: In the previous days, Shaan recalls that the cops were quite interested in the machinery, often studying it during sanitary checks and asking informations on it.

Clue 2: Just yesterday, a man in a bright red suit came asking about buying the machine for his own beauty saloon, planetside. Since the beauty treatments are quite lucrative, Shaan refused to sell to him. The guy didn't protest and immediately went away, as if not that interested.

> [!Rolls]

Since Officer Edoth is suspended, he will not be there at work.
Or is it?

> [!Rolls]
> FQ: Is Edoth at the police station? Unsure. 2, 8. 12. Yes.

Of course he is...

> 1d10 -> 9. Progress a thread. 
> I haven't filled up the plot nodes, so I'll roll on the Mythic Thread list for Pourne system instead. 
> 4. Investigate Face-Changing machinery theft.

> FQ: Do they find clues on the man in red? Unsure. 7, 4. 13. Yes. 
> FQ: Is he here? Very Unlikely. 1, 9. 10. No.

When the group arrives at the police station of the highport, they find Edoth at the station, in civilian clothing.

> [!Rolls]
> Character Conversation: Anxious, Careful.

> [!quote] Edoth
> He is quite surprised to see us there.
> "Aren't you supposed to be investigating the girl?" he says defensively while in the main lobby. "Got word that you are investigating the theft at the bitches' place."

> [!Quote] Jake

> [!NOTE]

> 2d6 + SOC + skill at 2. 11. Effect of 3, so normal success.

Edoth is still quite irate at the group, but seems to accept the story and leaves them while exiting the building.

> [!Rolls]
> Discovery Check: Is there something to notice for the clue of before? Very Likely.  10, 3. 17. Yes.

Normally I would check to see if they notice it, but PUM pushes for progress, so let's go.

> [!Rolls]
> Rolled New Linked Clue.
> Clue: Messy, Dirty.
> Linked Suspect: 6. Choose most logical. I say Edoth.

After Edoth has gone away, the group notices that the officer he was talking to quickly puts away a plastic container with open top, the one used for evidence storage.
Inside a very damaged red suit, dirtied by blood and some kind of grease with many holes in it, probably from laser shots.

Tagon asks about the suit.

> [!quote] Tagon
> "What happened and where did you find this red suit?"

I don't think he needs a check, since they have the official go to investigate.

> [!Rolls]
> FQ: Does the officer refuse to collaborate? Unsure. 1, 5. 8. No. 

The officer collaborates and explains what is available.

> [!Rolls]
> Where was found? Locations: Threatening, Artistic.
> What happened? 
> Actions: Betray, Agreement
> Descriptions: Powerfully, Comforting

According to the report of another officer, a man in a red suit was found stealing some art pieces from a local art gallery of the highport. After cops intervention, they had to shoot him, but he is now currently at the hospital while receiving care.

> [!Rolls]
> FQ: Does the report look fabricated? Likely, since it's an interesting coincidence to have the man in red show up so soon. 9, 6. 18. Exceptional Yes. Nice.
> What is suspicious? Description table: Weak, Gently.

Given the data on the weight and height of the man, which seems to be quite low and unthreatening, some of the descriptions of the actions he did during the robbery seems quite exaggerated, like tackling a way bigger officer.

The group decides to visit the art gallery first to collect evidence, maybe something will be on Edoth or his men?
After that, they will visit the man in red at the hospital.
They make sure to let the officers know of their investigation there, to avoid another false arrest.

> [!Rolls]
> Scene Question: The PCs reach the art gallery, right? 7, equal to CF and Odd, so Altered Scene.
> CF decreases by 1 to 6.
> Scene Adjustment Table: 7. Make 2 adjustments. Remove an Object and Increase an Activity.
> I would say, the object removed are their melee weapons that they are carrying upon entering. The activity increase will probably be a higher than expected presence of policemen.

Once they arrive there, the officers let them access the closed off building in the higher floors of the Pourne Space Station.
This place has a good view of the external part of the Station, which curves on both sides of where they are, creating a half moon shape, which grows in height the closer you are to the mid point.

To access though, they need to leave the melee weapons at the entrance, due to the high value of the objects inside.
Once obliged, they see a multi floor building full of art pieces from different parts of the known galaxy. Most of the space is taken by the Third Imperium pieces, but there are sections for all the Races.
All around, many officers go around, cataloguing all objects present even if there are no traces of damages anywhere.
After being sent upstairs, they find the location of the theft.

> [!NOTE]
> What does the place look like?
> Locations: Impressive, Watery.

The floor that they reach is the most grandiose one, all covered in white marble and golden detail, be them baroque-style chandeliers, wall lights, gold-plated tables and chairs. On the walls, many paintings are shown. This is remarkably one of the Third Imperium spaces. All looks grandiose thanks also to a gigantic suspended aquarium that gives light and movement to everything around, thanks to the refracted light from the system's star. If not for the absence of water all around, one would think of being underwater.

The traces of the theft are most visible in the absence of a glass on the part facing the void of space. In its place, a temporary metal lock has closed the loss of pressure. Some workers are cleaning up the broken glass and others are examining the damage to some sculptures and paintings near the broken window.

What else is happening?

> Actions: Conceal Conflict
> Descriptions: Naturally Extravagant
> Character Actions General: Care Inspect
> Object: Threatening Bright

While the workers are repairing the damage, some officers and a couple of what seems to be directors, are intently examining and discussing about a specific art piece. 
What seems to be a high tech plasma flashlight with some extravagant colouring, modified to act simultaneously as a homemade plasma ejector, similar to a raw plasma shotgun with a very limited range but great stopping power.
On its side the words "The Imperium" are hand written.
