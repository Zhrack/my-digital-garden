The group quickly finds their way to the nightclub, called Eyes’  Rest. It’s situated in a slightly hidden corridor of the station, out of eye’s view but sufficiently easy to reach.
Upon arriving, there are a few officers speaking with a middle aged and pompously dressed woman, who looks like the owner. A few younger boys and girls, all quite beautiful, are waiting outside, together with what seems like the clients. The place seems closed while the officers are checking the inside.
On the ground, with an officer taking photos and cataloguing it, is what seems to be a device, severely damaged by fire according to the scorch marks.

> FQ: Do they hear any rumors regarding what happened? Unsure. 10. No.
> FQ: Do they see Maeve there? I assume Officer Edoth gave them a description. Likely. 17. Yes, almost Exceptional.

While observing the situation, the Travellers try to ask other observers, but their responses seem contradictory and likely the result of inventive people.
After a bit, they see Maeve coming out of the nightclub.

> [!Rolls]
> Char Appearance: Aromatic Cute
> Char Descriptors: Curious-ly Truce
> Char Actions, General: Work Care

She has a small build and among the various styles covered by service personnel, she seems to cover the “cute” style, with pale green short hairs and comfortable clothes.
She has a serious look on her face and seems to be talking with an Officer, while she takes note of her declarations.

After one more hour, the Officer leave, letting the club reopen.
Almost immediately the music and the dances restart, as if nothing happened.

> [!Rolls]
> FQ: Does Maeve remains outside? Very Likely. 12. Yes.
> 

Maeve remains alone while smoking a cigarette. She has a tired look on her face but seems to be relaxing.

The group approaches her, does some small talk then tries to touch on the Officer.

> [!Rolls]
> Conversations: Intolerance Creepy
> 

The girl works there principally as waitress but occasionally dances as well.
She describe the Officer as a corrupt prick with a thing for smaller and young-looking girls. 
“When he and his colleagues are there, they take money, touch too much and try to push drugs on other clients.
If something happens, they were there investigating drug circles and come out clean. Last week I denounced one of them with some videos of drug usage, now he is suspended.”

> Char Action, General: Disrupt Hasty

“Edoth is trying to destroy any credibility and finding my evidence. He has been quite aggressive lately, but I hid those videos. This theft of the aesthetic machinery is probably linked somehow.”

> [!Comment]-
> So finding who stole the machinery could give insight on Edoth’s corruption and bring down his clique of corrupt officers.
> Could be useful in gaining trust from government, do something good as well and maybe make some local contacts of informants
> 
> To do so, I’ll use Mythic Mystery Matrix for the investigation. I will add Edoth, Maeve and the Nightclub Owner as suspects, but Edoth will have a first clue already linked, since he is quite interested in creating trouble for Maeve and the other girls.


The group accepts to investigate the matter, citing “justice” as a motivation. Maeve has seen enough to know there is something more, but won’t refuse their help.

They try to get close to the remaining device from the theft. The area has still some officers and the evidence from the theft has been put inside a bag by now. Once of them will need to stealthily reach the evidence and examine it.

> [!Rolls]
> Irthur sets up the stealth action with a Task Chain.
> Jake does an Electronic Comms check to examine the device.
> Stealth 8+. 6. Fail Effect -2, so DM -2 to Electronic check.
> Electronic 8+. 4. Fail. 

The duo gets near the officer with the evidence. Irthur distracts him by attracting his attention away using some falling boxes nearby. The trick doesn’t work and the officer remains vigilant.
Jake tries to get nearby enough to run a scan of the object, but he gets interrupted immediately.

> [!Rolls]
> FQ: Is he arrested? Likely. 13. Yes.

Shit. Let’s continue next time :)
