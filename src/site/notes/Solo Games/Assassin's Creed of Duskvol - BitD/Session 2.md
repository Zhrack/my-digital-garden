Since my Mystery Matrix is currently empty, the rules say that I have to generate both a Clue and a Suspect and link them together. I can choose or roll. I have an idea about a possible suspect, but let’s roll.

Suspect description table, from Mystery Matrix article: Careless, Mature.
Clue description table: Detailed, Motive

Well, Mythic confirmed my initial idea.
The suspect is the second target of my score, the other merchant. A greedy and careless old man.
The clue is given by some financial papers detailing how both merchants are creating a cartel to fix prices of some common imported manufactured goods, driving prices up and weakening the worker class into a worse quality of life.
Since Privah Segah is also on it, I will add him as an additional Linked Suspect to the same Clue. The other merchant is Fagreed Tarjen, of House Tarjen.

I add both to the Matrix and to the Mythic Character list. Also add a second entry for Sevoy, since he came up.

## Scene 4
> CF: 6, was in control.
> Expected scene: Templar or not, Privah Segah has to die. Konrad searches for him in the house.
> Test: 7, goes as expected.
> Domicile table: Lacking, Large. 

After exiting the main office, Konrad continues exploring the large, multifloor house. He hears some noises from a door. Spying from it, he can see that’s a small bathroom with someone inside. (lol)

> SURVEY roll to recognize who is there. If it’s visible, Fate Question to see if it’s Privah. 1d. Controlled/Standard. 5. Hesitation, a minor complication occurs.

While trying to identify the person, Konrad does a small sound. The person speaks: “Hey, bring me some paper, it’s all finished!”

FQ: Is it Privah? 50/50. 14. Yes.

Konrad looks around, no servitors or guards can be heard. He enters the bathroom quickly.
> SWAY to try to enter while acting as a servitor. 0d, I push myself, 1d for 2 stress, 1d for doing an ambush. Risky/Great. 4, 6. I do it.

Konrad enters quickly, surprising the merchant and quickly closing the door behind him while covering his face by keeping the back towards him. He then jumps on him while still seated on his throne.

> HUNT since he is attacking from surprise. I will not use the ambush bonus since I already used it. 2d. Controlled/Great, since he has surprise and the merchant is taken in a vulnerable moment. 5, 4.  Hesitation, I end up in a risky position.

Konrad tries to kill him quickly with the hidden blade, but a last moment reflex let the merchant dodge his attack. He stands up, trying to block his arms.

> SKIRMISH. 0d, but I would add 1d for the fact that the merchant is unarmed (my assumption since he was in the bathroom in his guarded house) . Risky/Great. 5. I do it but suffer harm. I try to resist. Prowess, 3 dots. 4, 4, 1. Take 2 stress but no harm.

After fighting with him, trading punches while Konrad manages to keep his mouth shut, he finally manages to push his head in the putrid water of the WC, keeping him under until he is no more.
After the ordeal, he quickly cut him with the blade dirtying a feather in his blood, a ritual sign of the Assassins of a finished job.
Konrad then pats him in search of other possible informations.

> FQ: Is something found? 50/50. 14. Yes. New Discovery Check!
> New Clue. Clue description: Quaint Technology.

On his bedroom clothes, he finds a pin of the Sparkwrights, humming with electroplasmic energy. That’s a pin given only to senior officers, and Privah was never in that organization. He must have some friends.
I’ll add the Sparkwrights as suspects. The name will change as soon as I have a specific suspect in that organization. Also the actual clue of the Pin, which might point to some corruption in the Sparkwright faction.

Next session, downtime and new score for Fagreed. Might want to investigate more before killing this time? We’ll see.
