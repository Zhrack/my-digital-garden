Score is done, let's do downtime activity. Let's use callboxes instead now, to have a better layout (Discord will probably not handle it... sorry)
> [! Rolls]
> 1. Payoff
> 	1. 2 REP by default, +1 REP per Tier higher, but who was the faction? I would say the Dockers? T3. We are T0, so +3 REP. 5 REP total.
> 	2. 6 COIN for a standard score. Konrad went inside the house of a medium merchant after all.
> 2. Heat
> 	1. +1 from well connected target. Low exposure for anything else. Score was in Chartedhall, which is a somewhat better neighbourhood, so I guess the merchant was there. Need to choose before next time. +1 from traces left in office from Devil's Bargain. No heat from killing due to Assassin's ability. 2 HEAT total.
> 3. Entanglements
> 	1. Rolled 1, Gang Trouble or The Usual Suspects. No cohorts yet, so let's go Usual Suspects. I volonteer Darmot, my Bluecoat friend as the target of the other Bluecoats. Since he is a colleague, they will probably go easier on him, so +1d.  2, 3. +2 HEAT.
> 4. Downtime
> 	1. First let's count the XP made. 
> 		1. Assassin crew get 3 XP, for successful score, main objectives achieved, improved REP.
> 		2. Konrad: 2 XP from multiple challenges resolved with stealth. 3 XP from desperate rolls. Need to sign these while playing.
> 	2. Actual downtime now:
> 		1. Konrad: 
> 			1. Indulge vice: Resolve is 1. 4. So back to 0 Stress.
> 			2. Reduce Heat: Tries to use Savoy the merchant as a contact to reduce Heat from Bluecoats on the recent murder. CONSORT, 2d since a contact is involved. 1, 2. 1 Heat, which I bump by one with 1 COIN.

Done.
Since I really missed the group mechanics in this score, I think it's good to add another PC, Gustav Morris, a dishonoured military Cutter.

I'll also check again how XP works and see what is needed to get a cohort to use. Still unsure if they can be used during a score. From the book, they seem mostly related to downtime activities.
That's it, quick session to do downtime this time.
