For this session, instead of Fate Questions, I will use the light Oracle from our own @Phil https://forums.runehammer.online/t/d6-oracle-and-flavor-roll-table/8937
You roll 2d6, 1 is for the oracle, the other for flavor. Easy and to the point. Since the system doesn’t have random events, I will try to roll more often, just to increase the randomness.

So, the Radiant Farms of Doskvol are mainly serviced by prisoners iirc. I would say that the place they run into is some sort of communal area enclosed with walls to better keep them under control during lunch time. It’s also well illuminated by torches and the walls have been improved by prisoners with various murales, depicting Leviathan’s hunting (the blood of these demonic whales is the base for the electroplasmic fuel) in the pitch-black sea, some Horrors and other places of the archipelago. Pretty dark and not very colorful in general.

No one is here at the moment. But what about Colfer?

> [!Rolls]
> Q: Is Colfer here? Likely. Yes/Really Bad.
> Character Actions, General: Threatening Generous
> Need more: Action table: Arrive Comfort.

While they look around for any signs of Colfer, they get distracted by the murales and their numerous eyes seemingly observing them.

> [!Rolls]
> Q: Is Colfer alone? Small Chance. 1. 2. No/Really Bad.
> Army Descriptor: Active-ly Calm.

While distracted, they are suddenly illuminated by a lamp and blinded for a moment, while a laughing voice is heard.

The voice of Colfer boasts for finding a couple of Assassins in such an easy way. 
After the blindness subsides, both see that Colfer is accompanied by a rather large group of thugs, around 10. 
He continues talking, speaking about how brute Assassins can’t possibly comprehend what it means to do research with electroplasmic energy and the endless possibilities in manipulating even the souls, and minds, of the living. To grant peace and order where chaos would reign due to the individual.
Said that, he orders the thugs to capture them, they will serve as good source of information on the Brotherhood.

> Now, Konrad will try a flashback.
> He has infiltrated a corrupted thug in the farms ahead of the score, and he is currently manning the lamp. Turning it off will give them a moment to flee.
> Since this was an unlikey opportunity, I say 1 Stress will be needed.
> Gustav instead will try to charge at Colfer in the moment, knock him out and run with him away, while Konrad helps him with a Setup.
> Konrad will use the sudden darkness to Ambush with HUNT. Desperate/Standard. 6, 5, 3. 6. He does it.
> Gustav will receive improved position from his help. He will do a SKIRMISH with Risky/Standard. 2, 2. Things go badly. End up in desperate position.

As soon as the lamp goes dark, Konrad kills a thug near Colfer with his blade, creating an opening.
This is not enough though, as another thug intercepts Gustav, interrupting his momentum and giving the group a moment to react.

> [!Rolls]
> Gustav tries to dispatch the thug and reach Colfer.
> Konrad assists, giving 1d extra. (forgot it the previous roll, better assist than setup)
> SKIRMISH Desperate/Standard. 2, 4, 6. He does it.

After dodging a… Blade in the dark from the thug (eheh), a throwing knife from Konrad goes straight for his throat, starting a fountain of blood while he holds the wound trying to breathe.
Gustav downs his armored fist on Colfer’s face, knocking him out and putting him on his shoulder, while both flee away from the remaining thugs and the corrupted one turns on the lamp, to fake a malfunction and save his ass.

Has anyone said chase time? :D
