# Scene 1
CF: 5
Let's generate the first score the get the ball rolling, from the Assassins opportunities.
First score: Two competing merchant houses put out a call for assassination of their rival.
Objective: Kill both and learn of any connections with Templars while doing so. Both are in Chartedhall neighbourhood.
Type: Stealth
Detail: Infiltration mode -> Entering from the canals under the house.
Load: light

Konrad goes to first house, House Segah.
Let’s ready an Alarm Clock for the house, 8 segments. 0/8

> Engagement roll: 1d base + low security 1d. Roll: 5, 4. Mixed. Risky position when action start.

Konrad arrives with a small gondola under the house, finding a small trapdoor used to discard refuses into the black water under it.
He reaches to the opening, opens the small wooden door and finds himself in a small room, with dirty crates full of refuses, a bad smell of rotting food and a burly guard, smoking while on duty. A door leads out of the room, but Konrad does some noise when closing the trapdoor behind him, attracting the guard’s attention. 

> Konrad tries to HUNT the guard, leaping from his cover and killing with his hidden blade. HUNT is 2, Risky position, standard effect. 2d= 2, 3. 3 total. Failure. No effect plus a consequence. I say I end up in a worse position. 1XP for stealth roll.

The guard manages to block the arm, avoiding the blow and pushing Konrad to the ground. After that, he unsheathe his sword and tries to hit back.

> SKIRMISH, desperate position, standard effect. 0, so 2d6 with disadvantagee. 3, 5 = 3, failure. I need to resist it with a resistance roll. 3 PROWESS, so 5, 5, 6. 6 stress - 6 = 0. Nice. +1 XP desperate roll. 1XP desperate action.

With that, Konrad rolls away and gets up, going again for the kill with the blade. 

> I say FINESSE here because he is more in control, Risky position, Standard effect. 2, failure. I resist it again. 6, 6, 4. Critical, I would clear 1 stress if I had any. Since it’s a critical and the fight is holding up too much: Konrad dodges another sword attack and pushes the hidden blade into the throat of the guard.

After disposing of the body in the trapdoor, he continues after the door.
Now that I think of it, I forgot to add +1d on the first strike for the Ambush ability of Konrad…

# Scene 2
The combat went worse than expected, CF is 6.
Expected scene: Explore location and search for Templar connections.
Test: 9. Expected.

> What do I find in the merchant house?
> Domicile Table: Storage, Animal.
> Some sort of personal zoo for an extravagant merchant.
> FQ: Are there any guards? 50/50. 13. Yes.

Some guards are patrolling what seems to be a large room with cages filled with exotic animals of many spacies.
Konrad tries to go past them, searching for some good intel in the merchant office, here somewhere. 

> It’s a PROWL roll. Risky/Standard. 1, 1. Failure. Consequence is a complication, going to Desperate position.

While skulking in the shadows, Konrad passes near a bird cage, alerting the animal that starts making noise. A couple of guards starts to look around, one going towards the cage. Konrad tries to distract the guards by opening the cage. 

> A FINESSE roll, being more related to a dexterity instead of TINKER. Desperate/Great, since the precious bird would be important to recuperate, so the effect would lead to a better situation. 1d for FINESSE. 5. 
> I do it, but I take a lesser effect instead. 1XP desperate action.

The bird flies out of the cage, losing some feathers in its mad dash for freedom. One of the guards ignores everything trying to go after it, while the other tries to look at the cage instead.

Konrad tries to ambush him when he gets close enough.
> HUNT roll. 2d +1d for Ambush ability. Still Desperate/Standard. 1, 1, 4. I do it but suffer a complication. I would increase the alert clock, but another guard is here already. +2 XP. Desperate stealth roll. 1XP desperate action.

Konrad kills him, but doesn’t manage to keep the body upright, knocking over the empty cage. Other animals are alerted, getting the attention of the other guard, which charges the assassin.

> SKIRMISH roll. 0d, so disadvantage. Risky/Standard since Konrad has time to recover a bit for the charge. 1. I go to desperate position.

Konrad is knocked over by the shoulder charge of the guard.

> SKIRMISH again. Desperate/Standard. 2. I lose the opportunity, but I resist it. 6 highest on Prowess, so 0 stress. Phew. 1XP desperate action.

While being knocked over, he notices the guard trying to run to another door to sound the alarm. Konrad manages to trip him by grabbing his foot. The guard drops down face first, a pool of blood starts to form around the head, he’s not moving.

Konrad leaves the bird flying around and moves the bodies in a corner. The blood is not easy to clean, no point in hiding the bodies too much.

# Scene 3
CF: 7, not in control at all.
Expected Scene: Search for the office room first, for Templar connections.
Test: 4. Interrupt, NPC Action. 
Rolled Sevoy, the merchant lord that is a contact for the Assassins.
Character Action, General table: Imitate, Aggressive.

Since there is no reason for another merchant to enter inside another merchant house in the middle of the night, I’ll consider the interrupt scene as a kind of heavily altered scene instead.

Konrad finds the office room. A finely detailed baroque room with golden details everywhere, stuffed animals dotting corners.
Easily findable, on the main desk, are numerous letters exchanged between Privah Segah, head of House Segah and Sevoy. In there, a negotiation goes on, in which Sevoy tries to make thinly threats of retorsion if a job is not carried out at the previously agreed rate. From the answer, the threat didn’t land.

Konrad tries to search in a more in depth way the room for correspondance and contracts.
> SURVEY roll. 1d. Controlled/Standard. Devil’s Bargain to leave traces conducting to the Assassins in the room, giving me +1 Heat after the score for +1d now. 1, 2. Fail. I resist. Insight, 3 dots. 3, 4, 6. 0 Stress. I ignore the risky opportunity from a failed controlled roll.

Since I should be able to find something if it’s present, I can do a Mystery Matrix Discovery Check.
FQ: Is anything found? Very Likely. 15. Yes.
Mystery Elements Table: New Linked Suspect. PP: 1
