New day, new score.
We didn’t have new things happen from entanglements, but the previous score objective was done. So I’ll remove the thread from Mythic. I wanted to kill the other merchant, but I think that it’s better to further investigate the available leads.
We know about a connection with the Sparkwright faction, the guild that works with all the new technology in Duskvol. We know about the other merchant as well, who paid us to kill his Cartel companion.
I want to investigate the Sparkwright faction. I do a Gather Information roll. Konrad asks Darmot, his Bluecoat contact, for the latest news on that.

> [!Rolls]
> CONSORT with him. When Gathering Information, only the effect matters, not the position. I say, since Darmot just got investigated by his colleagues, he’s not that inclined to talk, so Limited effect. 6.
> Actions table: Control, Poverty
> Descriptions table: Naturally, Rotten.

Darmot says that the Sparkwrights are currently busy with a ghost issue (they are an integral part of the world since the catastrophe that destroyed it) which seem to be rotting quickly. The issue is in the Barrowcleft district, where the Radiant Energy Farms are located. 
He can’t say much else and goes away. New Thread: Investigate the Rotting Ghosts.

We will need to infiltrate and gather information on the engineers.
Enough planning, let’s get rolling. Engagement roll. It’s a high security area, but full of people at the markets, so I guess it’s even.
> [!Rolls]
> 1d. 4. Starts with Risky position. I will keep the same load as before.

> [!Rolls]
> Expected Scene: Konrad and Gustav look around the market, following engineers actions.
> CF: 5
> Test: 2. Interrupt! Roll on Mystery Events Focus table, NPC Action.
> 
> __Templars__ picked from list __blades_chars__.
> 
> Nice! Templars added as well to the list again.
> Action table: Overthrow, Investment.
> Sounds like typical Templars.

While the duo is looking around, they hear some threats coming from a nearby clothing shop.
A few thugs seems to be speaking with a middle aged man. They don’t appear of any known faction, yet they seem bold enough to demand that the owner give up the shop to their boss, or else.


> [!Rolls] Rolls
> Konrad leads a PROWL group action to ambush them by entering and closing the door, before killing them. All PCs roll PROWL, the best applies to everyone.
> Gustav, 0d. 1, 3. 1.
> Konrad, 3d. 3, 6, 6. 
> Critical!

Both the Assassins enter the shop, close the door quietly and sneak the three thugs. Two are choked by Gustav, keeping each suspended in the air while clutching at their throats. Konrad chokes the remaining one.
After a moment, all three are dead.
“My friend, you don’t have anything to be afraid now. Sorry for the mess to clean, I’m sure there is a way. Don’t worry about the crows (in Duskvol, each time someone dies, some crows sense them, before their ghost can return. My crew has the ability to stop this sensing).”
Since it was a critical, I think it warrants a Discovery Check, since I can’t think of anything else.

> [!Rolls]
> FQ: Is anything found? Certain. 18. Exceptional Yes. 
> Roll twice but increase PP only once. 4, 2. I say Clue and Suspect. So New Clue and New Suspect.
> Clue table: Uncertain Possession.
> Suspect table: Classy, Reassuring.
> Clue: Probably a ghost who is possessing someone
> Suspect: Some kind of clergy member.

Finished time for this session, and I will need to check the book for a suitable clergy faction to involve, but exciting news.

After questioning, the shopowner says he doesn’t know anything about the boss the thugs were talking about, but he heard of a ghost of a recent victim of those same thugs who might know something more.

Next time!
