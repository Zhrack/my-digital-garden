The clerical faction is the Church of Ecstasy, the closest thing to a state religion in Duskvol. They see demons as perfect beings without spirit.

Thinking again about the clue, it doesn’t make sense to have a spirit as the clue. I would expect an object or information. Given those words, I would say that’s a iron ring with the symbol of the Church of Ecstasy on it. This links the Templars to someone in that Church.

After helping the shopowner disposing of the bodies, they return on the streets with his happy face watching them.

New scene.

Nice, I guess we are not the only Assassins doing scores tonight.

The due surveys the area for a while, before spotting some brothers and sisters doing the same.
They don’t know about other missions, but the others don’t seem intended in supporting them, ignoring the duo while looking around in the market stands.


> [!Rolls]
> SURVEY roll. I do it as a group action, since they are both doing the same action and both have 1 dot. Controlled/Standard since they are accompanied by other Assassins.
> Gustav. 3.
> Konrad. 5. 

The duo waits around for a bit, but doesn’t see any engineer doing anything suspicious. Since nothing seems to be happening, they instead try to go to the Radiant Farms where the ghost issue is, it’s risky, but it’s closer to the action.

The duo scouts around the perimeter and easily sees a group of engineer mostly walking in and out of a large warehouse building. Some pallid ghosts can be seen, ethereal and floating a few centimetres from the ground.
Spell Effects table: Imbue, Pain.
As said, there was a Rotten Ghosts problem here.
The Sparkwrights seem to be fighting, or trying to avoid, a Specter.
The creature looks at one of the unlucky engineers and he starts to wither away, as if aging 100 years in an instant. A flow of spiritual energy goes towards the spirit, which absorb it.

While they are occupied with the ghost, the assassins enters in another building, hoping for more clues.

The assassins enter in what seems to be a barn. All cows have been killed by life absorption like the engineer just outside.
Among the cows, also a person, dead as well, is in the corner. She seems to be holding an object under her body.

Let’s use my Discovery Check of before.

> [!Rolls] Rolls

> Let’s roll for which Clue. 82. Choose most logical. 
> Which Suspect. 8. Choose most logical.
> The most logical Suspect is the Sparkwright Officer. For the Clue, I choose the Church of Ecstasy Ring that was linked to the Templars.

Under the body is a small satchel, with several documents and the same Church of Ecstasy Ring that the Templars thugs had.
Looking quickly at the documents, most of them are orders and memos of the Sparkwrights. All of them come from an officer named Itha Delas.
One of the letters refers to the ring, with the order to be brought to the new “initiate” at this farm, named Colfer Withers.

Looks like our prime suspect is not here, but the initiate could be.
The due take the satchel, leaving the withered body of the courier where she is. Though luck, but can’t risk getting caught.

Quick session, to be continued.
