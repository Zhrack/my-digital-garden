From https://www.reddit.com/r/bladesinthedark/comments/ptiry0/what_do_you_think_are_some_of_the_key_differences/

I'd try not to overwhelm them with info-dumps unless they ask about stuff. The games are totally different, so I'd probably just make two main bullets (since they can remember two), then go over specific differences when they're coming up:

-   D&D is a game that is fundamentally built around combat. Your character class is mostly about combat abilities. This isn't D&D. **BitD is about daring scoundrels.** Combat exists, but combat isn't the focus, so don't think of it as the focus. Sneaking, social intrigue, and doing weird magic shit are all equally viable as combat so don't focus on making a combat character.
    
-   (Depending on the game you last played, YMMV) D&D is a game about heroic fantasy. This isn't D&D. BitD is about being scoundrels, and **scoundrels are underdogs**. You're going to lose sometimes. You're going to get bloody sometimes. You probably wont die, but your character will probably stress the fuck out. Life as a scoundrel isn't easy. This isn't a power fantasy.
    

Then I'd repeat: so, **BitD is about daring scoundrels, and scoundrels are underdogs** ... Lets talk about what kind of scoundrels you want to be. Lets look at the options for crews, which are basically "the party". So, what do you want your crew to be? what kinds of jobs do you want to take on?....  
Then I'd help them pick a crew, then start talking about individual characters.

When talking about making characters:

-   This is not D&D. There are no attack rolls and no AC, and no skill-checks either. **Action rolls** take care of all of that. The **die-pool system** means that [the distribution of results are a lot more predictable](https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/rol8g2/a_comparison_of_5_ternaryoutcome_dice_systems/hq45bll/) (compared to the swingy d20 in D&D). There is no roll where "nothing happens" (unlike D&D where if you swing and miss, nothing happens). The most common outcome of a roll is "mixed success", which means you get what you want but you also get something you don't want. Don't let this feel like failure. That's life because **scoundrels are underdogs**.
    
-   D&D can be played where you follow the rules (nearly) to the letter. In contrast, BitD has many places where you're meant to take the text as an example, not as a fact. For example, each character has access to a list of standard items, but think of that list as examples: stay within the theme, but feel free to be creative. You might carry an item that is not exactly what is written down, but that is similar to something on the list, and that's encouraged.
    
-   Your low-level characters are not as weak as lvl 1 D&D characters, but your high-level characters are not as unstoppable as lvl 10 D&D characters. Even your first character **is a daring scoundrel**, but even the greatest **scoundrel is an underdog**.
    
-   Levelling works very differently. Rather than getting a predetermined list of advances when you level, you get to pick and choose. You also level Action ratings separately from picking new Special Abilities. There are 4 XP tracks (then point them out on the sheet). Plus, you don't get XP for killing things or getting loot. You get XP for the way you roleplay and what your character does in the world (point to the section on the sheet). So, in addition to being **a daring scoundrel**, your character might focus on solving problems with X or Y, or A or B...
    
-   The HP system is totally different. It is hard to outright die in BitD, but you suffer negative effects from harm long before you are unconscious (as opposed to 1 HP being just as effective as 100 HP in D&D).
    

idk, that's some stuff.

I'd also tell them to read the Players Best Practices section for sure for sure for sure. That's gold. Something like that should be in every TTRPG book.
