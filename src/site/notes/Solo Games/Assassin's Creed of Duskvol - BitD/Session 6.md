New scene I guess.

> [!Rolls]
> CF: 3. In control.
> Expected scene: The assassins continue prowling around, finding Colfer.
> Test: 8. Expected.
> 
> Where do they go?
> Location table: Ruined Protection
> FQ: Is there a damage to the energy towers? Likely. 8, 6. 13. Yes.

While prowling around, they find themselves near the edge of the farms, where the luminous energy towers burn electroplasmic fuel to protect from the Horrors of the Deathlands, that surround the city.
Suddenly, an explosion comes from one of the minor towers, which starts to incline dungerously, without going completely down. The protection though fades away, with the dust from the explosion slowly settling down. 

The duo tries to get closer, maybe there is a way to reactivate the field if the tower is still standing. No need for even more ghosts while sneaking around.
The tall stone and timber building had some glasswork on the windows, which now lie shattered on the ground. A hole in a wall seems to be where the explosion happened.

> [!Rolls]
> FQ: Is there an Horror near the entrance? 50/50. 7, 4. 9. No.
> 

Both enter inside, hoping to find a fast way to reactivate the system.


> [!NOTE] Rolls
> Location table: Frantic-ly Full
> FQ: Is it full of people? 50/50. 3, 3. 6. No with Random event!
> Event Focus table: 7. Ambiguous Event.
> Description table: Anxiously Soft
> Action table: Easy Individual

Not people, there should be plenty of electroplasmic fuel in here, which is flammable and liquid. Quite anxiety inducing soft matter.


> [!NOTE] Rolls
> FQ: Is there a ghost? Likely. 2, 5. 6. No.

The room where the explosion came from seems to be the warehouse where the fuel was stored. A big hole testifies that a good chunk of it has blown up. A lot of fuel is still there however, thanks to the sturdy containers (think of the fuel glass containers from the videogame Dishonored) and a fire is ongoing.

Gustav and Konrad try to stop the fire from blowing the tower up definitely. After they will try to reactivate the tower, then resume the search for Colfer.


> [!Rolls]
> Group TINKER action. Risky/Standard.
> Konrad: Tinker 0. 5, 4. 4.
> Gustav: Tinker 0. 1, 2. 1.
> Group: 4
> Do it, but consequence. Gustav suffers harm.

While trying to douse the fire, Gustav holds a hot piece of metal and gets his hand burned. After a few minutes, the fire is isolated from the fuel, giving some respite to the duo.
Immediately after, they investigate the damage to the mechanism, hoping to be able to restart the protective field.


> [!Rolls]
> Group SURVEY to assess the situation.
> Risky/Great, since it will inform the next TINKER rolls.
> Konrad: Survey 1. 1.
> Gustav: Survey 1. 1. O.O
> Konrad resists. 3d6. 6, 6, 6. Critical! Clear 1 stress (already at 0). Resisted.
> So it goes badly but no consequences.
> FQ: “Is the situation of the tower bad?” Nearly Certain.  7, 5. 14. Yes.

While looking at the machine burning electroplasmic fuel to generate the protective field, they notice that most of the burnable parts are badly damaged. The machine needs new parts to restart, so nothing can be done quickly.
Instead of searching for possible parts, they decide to quickly survey the area and GTFO, before any Horror can arrive.
Speaking of which…
> [!Rolls]
> FQ: “Does an Horror appears after this time?” Likely. 5, 3. 7. No.

Lucky…
So the assassins try to search for any clues of Colfer.
Since they already crossed some obstacles, I will consider the Discovery Check earned.

> [!Rolls]
> FQ: “Is anything discovered?” Almost Certain. 7, 4. 11. Yes.
> Mystery Elements Table for Clues: 9. Link Clue to Suspect or New Clue.
> Since the only clue not connected is “Merchant Cartel increasing prices” and I can’t see a connection, I’ll roll a new one.
> Clue Descriptor table: Heavy Academic.
> Roll again for inspiration: Cold Frightening

I think they find among the salvaged objects, a device usable to create a small localized Ghost repellant area around the user. Looks to be a new prototype device and has a small tank for fuel.
Activating it is easy, since there is a button. During operation, the device becomes extremely cold, requiring some protection when handling.
One thing they notice is a small Templar symbol and the name C. Withers attached to it.
I guess we have a new Suspect and the Clue is connected to him.

After retrieving this, they go away from the tower, hearing the shouts of people coming to close the protective gap.

Will choose where they go next session!
New scene as well.
